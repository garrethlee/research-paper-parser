Other," Wearable Bluetooth Sensors for Capturing Relational Variables and Temporal Variability in Relationships: A Construct Validation Study James G. Matusik Michigan State University Ralph Heidl University of Oregon John R. Hollenbeck, Andrew Yu, and Hun Whee Lee Michigan State University Michael Howe Iowa State University The advent of wearable sensor technologies has the potential to transform organizational research by offering the unprecedented opportunity to collect continuous, objective, highly granular data over extended time periods. Recent evidence has demonstrated the potential utility of Bluetooth-enabled sensors, specifically, in identifying emergent networks via colocation signals in highly controlled contexts with known distances and groups. Although there is proof of concept that wearable Bluetooth sensors may be able to contribute to organizational research in highly controlled contexts, to date there has been no explicit psychometric construct validation effort dedicated to these sensors in field settings. Thus, the two studies described here represent the first attempt to formally evaluate longitudinal Bluetooth data streams generated in field settings, testing their ability to (a) show convergent validity with respect to traditional self-reports of relational data; (b) display discriminant validity with respect to qualitative differences in the nature of alternative relationships (i.e., advice vs. friendship); (c) document predictive validity with respect to performance; (d) decompose variance in network-related measures into meaningful within- and between-unit variability over time; and (e) complement retrospective self-reports of time spent with different groups where there is a “ground truth” criterion. Our results provide insights into the validity of Bluetooth signals with respect to capturing variables traditionally studied in organizational science and highlight how the continuous data collection capabilities made possible by wearable sensors can advance research far beyond that of the static perspectives imposed by traditional data collection strategies.

Abstract," Organizations are complex social systems, composed of net- works of individuals that interact, communicate, and coordinate activity within and across levels and time ( Kozlowski & Klein, 2000 ). Accordingly, a great deal of organizational research has focused on relational variables at various levels of analysis, in- cluding the dyadic (i.e., two individuals), team, and network (i.e., whole system) levels. For example, hundreds of studies have examined the important, dyadic relationships that form between leaders and followers ( Dulebohn, Bommer, Liden, Brouer, & Ferris, 2012 ). Likewise, teams research has been recognized as a dominant and growing topic area in organizational science ( Ma- thieu, Hollenbeck, van Knippenberg, & Ilgen, 2017 ;  Morrison, 2010 ). In the domain of network research, network characteristics have been identified as major determinants of a variety of out- This article was published Online First August 2, 2018. James G.

Indeed, the recognition that organizations are inher- ently relational arenas has propelled organizational science for- ward. Some limitations associated with methods widely used in orga- nizational science, however, have thus far hindered researchers’ ability to capture the richness of many relational constructs, espe- cially as they change or evolve over time. Generally speaking, research on relational variables has relied on cross-sectional or before/after approaches captured with self-reported data or direct observations from others, both of which are affected by the limits of human memory and subject to a host of biases ( Lazer et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, traditional approaches, such as surveys and diaries, are taxing on participants and often result in low response rates, especially in longitudinal contexts where repeated measure- ments are required. Even if one moves beyond surveys and diaries, other existing methods of studying human interaction, such as video and audio recordings, are time consuming to code and impose geographical constraints on data collection. Fortunately, recent technological advancements have the poten- tial to overcome some of these limitations, supplement traditional data collection practices, and, consequently, open entirely new lines of research. Specifically, wearable sensor technologies (WSTs) could revolutionize the way organizational scientists con- duct research on a range of relational variables ( Pentland, 2012 ). The use of WSTs is already gaining traction in many applied contexts where they have been used to track interactions among individuals in a variety of environments, including schools ( Four- net & Barrat, 2014 ;  Mastrandrea, Fournet, & Barrat, 2015 ), social events ( Panisson et al., 2012 ), and even work organizations ( Alshamsi, Pianesi, Lepri, Pentland, & Rahwan, 2015 ). Despite the proliferation of WSTs, however, there has been little in the way of traditional construct validation studies dedicated to measures de- rived from these sensors. Indeed, construct validation evidence for assessing relational variables with wearable sensor data is scarce for controlled environments (for an exception see  Chaffin et al., 2017 ) and nonexistent for extended duration field studies. This is problematic because WSTs must be shown to be construct-valid data collection instruments ( Schwab, 1980 ) before researchers use them to conduct substantive organizational re- search and before employers use them to track behavioral patterns. Hence, the primary purpose of the studies presented here is to validate one particular WST, namely Bluetooth (BT), in field settings. We chose to focus exclusively on BT given the results of Chaffin et al. (2017) , in which it was determined that, among several WSTs examined, the most promising and robust WST was the BT sensor. As such, this current investigation is in no way the first “ground truth” assessment of BT, which was provided by Chaffin et al. (2017)  in their series of laboratory studies. Instead, it is the first realistic, multiday validation effort of WSTs in field contexts. In our first of two studies, we use wearable BT sensors (man- ufactured by Sociometric Solutions, recently rebranded as Hu- manyze, Boston, MA) to capture interaction dynamics in a large- scale, multimillion dollar scientific installation. In the second of two studies, we use wearable BT sensors (manufactured by Limefy, Seattle, Washington) to track day-to-day interactions among team supervisors in a heavily monitored environment, providing additional ground truth evidence but in a less controlled setting than those in  Chaffin et al. (2017) . In conducting this second study, we not only evaluate the validity of this alternative BT sensor but also assess its convergence with the BT sensors embedded in the Humanyze device. The results of this test of convergence support  Chaffin et al.’s (2017)  recommendation and our own belief that researchers should focus on the WST itself (i.e., BT), such that the technology should not be confounded with its instantiation (i.e., the manufacturer). Thus, this validation effort builds upon the laboratory studies of Chaffin et al. (2017)  with two new field studies, and it represents the next logical step toward establishing WSTs as valid data collection instruments. Importantly, the three most basic differ- ences between this study and  Chaffin et al. (2017)  are that (a) Chaffin et al. (2017)  was based entirely on laboratory research that was (b) specifically aimed at assessing the ground truth accuracy of several different WSTs (BT, microphones, and infrared detec- tors), and (c) did not capture relational or network dynamics as a function of changes in activity states in a field setting. While laboratory research is an important endeavor and critical first step before WSTs are deployed in field contexts, evidence of their validity in field contexts could add substantially to their perceived utility by practitioners and organizational researchers alike. This is evidence we hope to provide. To accomplish this objective, we evaluate the construct validity of BT sensors using traditional psychometric procedures, assessing their ability to capture interactions as well as fundamental rela- tionships often studied in organizational research (i.e., advice- and friendship-oriented relationships). Specifically, we test the ability of BT-generated data to demonstrate (a) convergent validity with respect to traditional self-reports of relational variables; (b) dis- criminant validity with respect to qualitative differences in rela- tionships (i.e., advice-oriented vs. friendship); (c) predictive va- lidity with respect to individual performance in a context where boundary spanning (i.e., brokerage) is critical; (d) systematic vari- ance decomposition of within- and between-unit variation in com- mon network constructs at the “daily” level; and (e) incremental validity, beyond retrospective self-reports, for predicting time spent with different groups in a context where ground truth is known. The results of this validation effort offer several contributions to organizational research. First, we provide evidence that BT sensor- generated proximity data may be able to detect and track affective and task-oriented relationships among individuals in field settings. Indeed, our findings suggest that BT sensors can assist researchers interested in studying friendship and advice-oriented relationships, which have been identified as central elements of informal orga- nizational networks ( Gibbons, 2004 ;  Morrison, 2002 ), as well as established network characteristics such as brokerage opportuni- ties ( Burt, 2004 ). Second, we demonstrate that BT sensor- generated data is capable of capturing interpersonal interactions, more generally, as we provide evidence that this data may be used to determine the proportion of time one spends with others in various, known locations, above and beyond self-reports. By pro- viding evidence of wearable BT sensors’ ability to estimate known time spent with others in field settings, as well as capture self- reported relationships, we contribute to the realization of their potential as a valuable addition to existing methods of data col- This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Third, and importantly, we find that the exploitation of this technology’s unique strengths may allow researchers to address entirely new research questions. Above and beyond their ability to provide more objective and efficient methods for data collection, the temporal granularity associated with wearable BT sensor- generated data opens novel lines of research that could hardly be contemplated, let alone attempted, with existing methods. Specif- ically, the opportunity to more deeply explore issues related to the dynamic nature of individual and organizational network charac- teristics, with a focus on “within-unit” rather than “between-unit” variability in network variables (i.e., how one’s position in the network varies on a day-to-day basis rather than how one’s typical position in the network differs from the typical position of other individuals, more generally), has been difficult to explore. This is due almost entirely to the limitations associated with traditional, labor intensive survey approaches that tend to rely on a reduced number of coarse-grained, aggregate snapshots that make the im- plicit assumption that relationships among individuals are rela- tively stable and largely focus attention on between-unit variance. If recent trends in organizational research have anything to teach us, it is that unpacking within- and between-unit variance often leads to profound discoveries. Indeed, the importance of isolating and separating within- ver- sus between-unit variability has been documented repeatedly in various subfields of organizational research (e.g.,  Dalal, Lam, Weiss, Welch, & Hulin, 2009 ;  Matta, Scott, Colquitt, Koopman, & Passantino, 2017 ;  To, Fisher, Ashkanasy, & Rowe, 2012 ), at times casting doubt on the meaningfulness of the between-unit score. At the very least, the recognition that a large percentage of variance on a given variable was residing at a heretofore unrecognized level opened new avenues of inquiry, such as why a leader may adhere to justice norms on one day, but not another ( Scott, Garza, Conlon, & Kim, 2014 ). In the present investigation, we show how wearable BT sensors, which scan their environments multiple times per minute, offer the unprecedented opportunity to unpack within- and between-unit variance in network characteristics at multiple levels of analysis. Our analyses show that a significant proportion of variance in some individual network characteristics resides within individuals, such that any single individual’s position within the broader network may vary greatly from day-to-day. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this within-individual variance is mean- ingful as it may reflect actual changes in activity states of the entire network under examination (e.g., the network’s transition from planning a project to actual execution). Finally, we contribute to computational social science research on organizational behavior ( Olguin et al., 2009 ;  Pentland, 2012 ) and social network dynamics ( Cattuto et al., 2010 ;  Sekara, Stop- czynski, & Lehmann, 2016 ), more generally, by providing a com- prehensive validity assessment of a frequently used data compo- nent (i.e., BT). Computational social science is fundamentally data-driven and leverages the increasing availability of large scale, longitudinal data that contains relational information, such as phone call records, e-mails, GPS, and radio frequency identifica- tion data, to study individual and collective behavior ( Lazer et al., 2009 ). In doing so, computational social science researchers often triangulate BT data with data from other sources and sensors to increase the validity of derivative relational variables ( Stopczynski et al., 2014 ). Thus, our research complements and informs com- putational social science research on social networks by providing evidence concerning the validity of BT-derived relational vari- ables."
Wearable Sensor Technologies in Organizational Research," WSTs hold a great deal of promise for organizational research because they allow researchers to collect copious amounts of objective, granular data over extended time periods. However, a major weakness of WSTs often overlooked by researchers is that each sensor must be attached to an individual, and alternative attachment modes strongly influence the accuracy of measure- ments. That is, several WSTs may be combined into a multisensor, wearable measurement system that has a single point of attachment (e.g., worn loosely around the chest), and that single point of attachment may not be optimal for the different component sen- sors. For example, the audio signal produced by a microphone is compromised if it is captured at a person’s chest instead of near his or her mouth. The light detection signal of an infrared sensor, interpreted as face-to-face alignment, is similarly compromised if the sensor is placed on the chest and not the face. Indeed, in assessing the validity of multisensor wearable measurement sys- tems,  Chaffin et al. (2017)  determined that variance exists in the usefulness of various sensors, most of which could be traced to attachment problems and differences in sensitivity between micro- phones, infrared sensors, and accelerometers. One WST examined by  Chaffin et al. (2017) , however, offered greater proof of concept relative to others. Specifically, BT sensors were determined to be very accurate in detecting proximity events over extended periods of time where ground truth was known. Furthermore, BT sensors were far more robust proximity sensors than infrared with respect to errors of omission (i.e., false nega- tives). These findings, coupled with the ubiquity of BT in both the emerging WST literature (e.g.,  Eagle, Pentland, & Lazer, 2009 ; Sekara & Lehmann, 2014 ;  Stopczynski et al., 2014 ) and mobile consumer devices, led us to focus explicitly on wearable BT sensors in the present investigation, with the goal of assessing their validity and utility for organizational research."
Wearable Bluetooth Sensors," BT sensors are pervasive commodities that are standard com- ponents embedded in many consumer communication devices. Originally conceived as a data transfer technology ( Ferro & Po- torti, 2005 ;  Haartsen, Naghshineh, Inouye, Joeressen, & Allen, 1998 ), BT sensors can detect the presence of other BT-enabled devices within a specified range, with the maximum range of detection ranging from 1 m to 100 m ( Wang & Iqbal, 2006 ) depending on sensor specification. The minimal inquiry length (i.e., temporal resolution, or amount of time between sweeps for other sensors) of BT sensors varies between sensors, with some sweeping once every couple of seconds and others sweeping approximately once per minute ( Kammar, McNutt, Senese, & This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 359 WEARABLE BLUETOOTH SENSORS Bray, 2002 ). Given their range and inquiry length, BT sensors can generate a considerable number of detections in a relatively short period of time. A detection generated by a BT sensor includes information about (a) when the detection took place; and (b) the strength of the received radio signal (i.e., how far apart the two sensors were when a detection was registered). Thus, BT data records consist of a time/date stamp, sender identifier, receiver identifier, and a radio signal strength indicator (RSSI). RSSI is a measure of the strength of the signal received from a proximate BT sensor. Importantly, the range of RSSI depends on the specifications of the BT sensor. The ability of BT sensors to detect other BT-enabled devices has been leveraged by prior researchers to record and infer colocation situations among individuals (e.g.,  Eagle et al., 2009 ;  Sekara & Lehmann, 2014 ). In assessing the potential of BT technology for research, it is important to recognize that the original purpose of RSSI, which researchers often rely on to determine whether a registered BT detection represented a meaningful interaction op- portunity, was to describe the quality of a wireless communication link for data transfer. The use of RSSI to measure spatial separa- tion in human interaction is a relatively novel application that falls outside the original scope of the technology’s intended use. Thus, a clear understanding of the relationship between BT RSSI and spatial separation is a necessary precondition for meaningful be- havioral applications. In this context, three characteristics of BT RSSI are of importance. First, RSSI is recorded as a negative value and typically ranges from  � 50 to  � 100 (though this range may vary by sensor). Less negative RSSI values, or values that are smaller in absolute value, represent shorter distances between BT sensors while more nega- tive RSSI values, or values that are larger in absolute value, represent greater distances between BT sensors. Thus, a detection with an RSSI value of  � 70 presumably represents a shorter distance between BT sensors (when the detection was registered) than a detection with an RSSI value of  � 75,  � 80,  � 95, and so on. Second, RSSI data recorded by BT sensors positioned at a fixed distance follow the pattern of a Gaussian normal distribution ( Ramadurai & Sichitiu, 2003 ;  Sichitiu & Ramadurai, 2004 ). This is important because it suggests that while BT detection strength (RSSI) may produce a noisy and relatively unreliable measurement of spatial separation for any individual observation, its random error distribution should allow the “true” RSSI value to emerge over several observations. This has implications for behavioral research designs concerning the choice of a suitable observation and deployment period for BT sensors, such that larger windows of observation should facilitate the cancellation of random error. Third, because BT signal attenuation does not follow a linear path and depends on sensor specification, the traditional engineer- ing practice of establishing a dichotomous, binary (i.e., yes/no) signal strength  threshold  to identify colocation events between two individuals is problematic, psychometrically. For example, previ- ous sensor-specific calibration efforts identified an RSSI of  � 80 as an appropriate threshold (approximately 3 m;  Kalimeri, 2013 ) for face-to-face interactions ( Finnerty, Kalimeri, & Pianesi, 2014 ; Olguin et al., 2009 ), such that any detections with RSSIs less than  � 80 (e.g.,  � 81) would be excluded from analyses as they would represent distances supposedly too great to suggest interac- tion (thus, eliminating conference room interactions, as well as individual broadcasting to people in a small classroom). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that the choice of a particular threshold setting has a substantial impact on the derivative colocation struc- ture ( Chaffin et al., 2017 ). Thus, meaningful binary threshold- based colocation diagnostics are contingent on the appropriate definition of an interaction threshold distance (highly context- specific) and require the calibration of every BT sensor RSSI with respect to this distance. Moreover, by using binary BT RSSI thresholds, one is trans- forming a continuous variable into a dichotomous variable and discarding potentially meaningful signal variance in the assess- ment of relational behavior (e.g., friendship vs. task-related inter- actions). Although some researchers have found evidence that thresholding techniques might allow one to infer qualitative dif- ferences in interaction patterns ( Sekara & Lehmann, 2014 ), others have acknowledged that using a relatively strict cut-off, such as one that corresponds to just a few meters (e.g., 3 m), could lead to many false negative detections ( Onnela, Waber, Pentland, Schnorf, & Lazer, 2014 ). The recognition of these technical and analytical limitations clarifies why initial attempts to leverage BT technology for social and behavioral research need to use a wide range of BT-generated proximity data (in terms of RSSI) and collect this data over extended time periods. Fortunately, a key advantage of WSTs is that they do allow for the mass collection of high-resolution, temporal data over ex- tended observation periods, which may help to overcome some of the aforementioned limitations while also providing insight on the social context in organizations (i.e., relationships). Leveraging the full information contained in the RSSI signal avoids issues with determining an appropriate dichotomous threshold, reduces the restriction in range which may otherwise limit the ability of BT data to converge (i.e., correlate) with self-report relational mea- sures as traditionally assessed in organizational research, and opens the possibility of discriminating between different interac- tion contexts. Furthermore, collecting this data over extended periods allows random error to cancel out and provides a relatively stable and accurate estimation of true proximity. Equipped with an understanding of BT’s usage in the burgeon- ing WST literature, as well as the information embedded in the data that BT sensors generate, we now explicitly turn our attention to the validation of this technology in field contexts."
Validation of Bluetooth Sensors," Traditional psychometric construct validation of BT-generated data is an important first step before any substantive research (or employer-based tracking) involving BT sensors should take place. Ensuring construct validity, or correspondence between relational variables (i.e., constructs) and BT-generated data (i.e., measures; Schwab, 1980 ), is critical for at least three reasons. First, without validation we run the risk of mistakenly interpreting spurious findings due to the high-powered empirics associated with the large number of observations BT sensors generate. As noted, BT sensors are capable of generating sizable amounts of data given their frequent sweeps for other BT-enabled devices, and therefore they provide researchers with a high level of statistical power. To ensure that meaningful patterns of interaction and activity are being captured by BT sensors, rather than mere colocation, it is critical that evidence of their ability to detect known relationships is provided in advance.

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 360 MATUSIK ET AL. Second, failure to validate BT sensors before engaging in sub- stantive research or practical use makes it impossible for organi- zational researchers to identify the reasons that they are unable to replicate their own or others’ results. That is, without validating BT sensors and other WSTs before utilizing them, it is not possible to know whether a failed replication using BT-generated data is a product of the researcher’s methodological approach, their theory, or the technology itself. Finally, and as recognized by  Chaffin et al. (2017) , many WSTs offered by manufacturers provide constructs that are defined with engineering standards in mind and calculated using proprietary algorithms. That is, to date, evaluation standards for variables derived from WSTs have been approached from an engineering angle rather than a psychometric angle, and in many cases the goal that an engineer has when creating a metric differs from that of a psychometrician. For example, in an effort to measure social dominance an engineer’s priority is to ensure that the minutes of verbal activity recorded by an audio device is identical to the actual number of minutes spoken. However, when constructing a measure of social dominance, a psychometrician might only be interested in multiple fallible indicators that capture the true rank- ordering or equal-interval discrimination of people on that broad construct. From a construct point of view, a valid rank-ordering or equal-interval discrimination of people from multiple indicators is more relevant in assessing social dominance than the simple count of minutes of speaking time (or some permutation thereof), which is likely to be contaminated and/or deficient for the purpose of describing social dominance. In addition, a traditional practice within engineering fields is to use “thresholding” to convert con- tinuous data into dichotomous counts, where in traditional psycho- metric contexts every effort is made to keep variables in their continuous form (e.g.,  Stöber, Dette, & Musch, 2002 ). Although engineers and psychometricians strive to achieve sim- ilar goals via different methods, both groups often use the same vocabulary when referring to relational constructs. When one couples these differences with the fact that most WST providers rely on complex and often proprietary signal processing algo- rithms, this makes it impossible for researchers to evaluate these newly (re)defined constructs. Therefore, validating and utilizing raw detection signals (i.e., BT-generated data) may prove to be a more promising and successful approach than naïvely relying on proprietary, manufacturer-provided constructs, which is often the alternative when one uses WSTs. Accordingly, our attention is explicitly focused on the validation of the transparent, raw detec- tion data generated by wearable BT sensors."
Convergent Validity of Bluetooth Data With Self-Reported Relational Variables," As noted, the ability of BT technology to detect other BT- enabled devices has been leveraged by prior researchers to record and infer colocation situations among individuals. Given potential concerns about the validity of this technology, our first research question pertains to the  convergence  of BT proximity data, gen- erated in field contexts, with self-reported relational data. Specif- ically, we examine the extent to which BT data converges with self-reports of friendship and advice-oriented relationships as these informal ties have been identified as key elements of informal networks ( Gibbons, 2004 ;  Morrison, 2002 ). Although self-reports are not always completely accurate, BT sensors should generate data that converges with commonly used measures in organiza- tional research for them to represent valuable data collection tools in this domain. This test of convergence represents the fundamental first step in our investigation as a lack of evidence of convergent validity would preclude the possibility of interpreting the results of subse- quent analyses. Without first establishing that BT-generated data does indeed correlate with self-reported relational data, the results of all other analyses would be highly questionable. Thus, to take the initial step toward integrating BT sensors into organizational research, we use a wide range of proximity data collected over several weeks in a field setting to address our first research question: Research Question 1:  Does cumulative Bluetooth proximity data converge with self-reported relational data in a field setting?"
Discriminant Validity of Bluetooth Data for Assessing Alternative Relational Variables," Our second research objective pertains to the use of BT prox- imity data to  discriminate  between various types of relationships. Whereas WSTs can help overcome some of the shortcomings of self-reports, the value of the data generated by proximity sensors may be limited by the absence of contextual information related to subtle distinctions between various types of relationships. For example, traditional network surveys make distinctions regarding the nature of interactions by offering different items for advice- versus friendship-oriented relationships. In contrast, current ana- lytical approaches related to BT data consider all proximity detec- tions above a single dichotomous threshold (e.g., RSSI of  � 80) essentially the same. If the nature of human interaction were to be reflected in spatial separation (i.e., personal space), alternative analytical approaches could exploit the richness of the granular proximity data generated by BT sensors. Several types of relationships exist within organizations, but, as previously noted, we chose to focus explicitly on task-related and friendship-oriented relationships. These relationships, which have been identified as central elements of informal networks, are particularly relevant to our research objective as they are not stipulated by the organization (e.g.,  Gibbons, 2004 ) and, therefore, researchers typically rely on self-reports or third-party observation to capture them. Although these two types of relationships can coexist, they differ in their nature and central characteristics. Friendship networks, or networks composed of positive amica- ble relationships, are social in nature and are characterized by high levels of intimacy, trust, and social support. Friendship is relatively informal and affective in nature, and the interaction patterns that characterize friendships are likely distinct from the interaction patterns that characterize formal, task-oriented relationships. That is, it is plausible that friendship interactions unfold more fre- quently in constrained spaces (offices, lunch tables, break areas, etc.), and hence, shorter distances. On the other hand, task-based relationships are more formal. Frequently, these interactions take place in contexts that are less space-constrained, allowing for interactions to occur over greater distances (e.g., conference rooms, small classrooms, etc.). Indeed, This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 361 WEARABLE BLUETOOTH SENSORS prior research suggests that friendship and task-related relation- ships are differentially related to physical propinquity ( Ibarra & Andrews, 1993 ;  Sias & Cahill, 1998 ). Accordingly, there exists the potential for the differences between primarily friendship and primarily task-related (i.e., advice-oriented) interactions to be re- flected in recorded BT RSSI values. Thus, we examine the corre- lations between BT-generated data at various discrete RSSI values with self-reports of friendship and advice-oriented relationships to address our second research question: Research Question 2:  Can one use discrete Bluetooth RSSI values to discriminate between self-reports of friendship and task-related relationships in a field setting?"
Criterion-Related Validity of Bluetooth-Generated Variables for Predicting Performance," Our third research question pertains to the ability of BT- generated data to predict important organizational criteria such as job performance. Indeed, for BT sensors to be considered a valu- able supplement to existing methods of data collection they must contribute to researchers’ ability to predict outcomes of critical interest in organizational contexts. When it comes to performing one’s job well, an individual’s position in the network has been shown to be highly relevant. The literature on interpersonal networks tends to associate different types of benefits with different network structures, but it is gen- erally well-accepted that individuals in more central network po- sitions accrue advantages because they have timelier access to richer and more diverse information. These individuals learn more from their network than their less connected peers, and thus develop greater potential to synthesize and recombine this infor- mation into novel ideas (e.g.,  Burt, 2004 ;  Ebadi & Utterback, 1984 ;  Morrison, 2002 ). Research on the relationship between individual (i.e., ego) net- work structure documents a replicable positive effect of number of brokerage opportunities (i.e., structural holes) on individual knowledge creation ( Burt, 2004 ;  Fleming, Mingo, & Chen, 2007 ; McFadyen, Semadeni, & Cannella, 2009 ). The positive effect of brokerage opportunities on individual performance should be par- ticularly salient in knowledge-intensive organizations character- ized by high task interdependence and extreme levels of special- ization ( Clement, Shipilov, & Galunic, in press ). Accordingly, we expect that in the field context of our first study, which involves people working collaboratively on a large scientific installation, an individual’s performance increases with the number of his or her brokerage opportunities. Thus, our third research question: Research Question 3:  Can one use network measures derived from wearable Bluetooth-generated data to predict future job performance in a field setting?"
Variance Decomposition of Daily Networks: Within- Versus Between-Unit Variance," Although assessing the ability of BT-generated colocation data to (a) display convergent validity with self-reports of relational data; (b) show discriminant validity with respect to qualitative differences in relationships; and (c) provide predictive validity with respect to performance are all important objectives, each of those objectives can be accomplished without fully taking advan- tage of the unique strengths of this technology. To accomplish the first three objectives, one simply aggregates the BT-generated data to arrive at a single “unit” score for the focal dyad (convergent and discriminant validity) or individual (predictive validity). However, as we stressed at the outset, what makes wearable BT sensors a particularly disruptive technology when used in an organizational context is their ability to collect continuous, objective, highly granular data over extended periods. This creates the opportunity to construct network graphs on a weekly, daily, or even hourly basis—an opportunity that is unprecedented in organizational re- search. For example, over the course of a year BT technology could enable one to generate 365 daily network graphs for a particular context. One could “average over” these graphs to assign a single score to each unit (where the unit could be at the individual level, the dyadic level, or the whole-network level) and use this single score to make between-unit comparisons. Indeed, this would be reflective of approaches traditionally taken in network research. However, the failure to recognize the variability in the 365 net- works that display themselves throughout the year would be a major missed opportunity. Simply examining the “average” net- work or individuals’ “average” positions within the network glosses over a host of potentially meaningful configurations based upon time that are worthy of study. These temporally bounded networks may reflect incremental linear network evolutions, cy- clical seasonal variations, or discontinuous reconfigurations as the group confronts different tasks or responds to external shocks, all of which are systematic and worthy of theory and empirical examination. Regrettably, the labor-intensive nature of existing data col- lection methods for capturing networks not only makes it un- feasible to study such possibilities but also precludes our ability to ask even the most basic question: How much of the variance in traditional network measures is within units and how much is between units? As we noted earlier, research on constructs that were traditionally or solely approached from a between-unit perspective, but then approached from a within-unit perspec- tive, has consistently found that very large portions of variance in constructs reside within units when they are measured over time (e.g.,  Dalal et al., 2009 ;  Johnson, Lanaj, & Barnes, 2014 ; Matta et al., 2017 ;  Stewart & Nandkeolyar, 2007 ;  To et al., 2012 ). Methodological approaches that make this formerly “in- visible” variance visible and analyzable create new and inno- vative opportunities for theory building, theory testing, and exploration. For example, a dynamic, within-unit perspective opens the door for a closer examination of individual agency, which could prove relevant for research on tie stability (i.e., the stability of interpersonal connections) as well as network struc- tural periodicity (i.e., the regularity of activity states; cycles of activity). Thus, our fourth research question: Research Question 4:  Can daily colocation networks derived via Bluetooth data be used to (a) partition the variance asso- ciated with network parameters into between- versus within- unit portions, and (b) detect a major discontinuous change in a network’s temporal evolution?

Incremental Validity of Bluetooth Data for Capturing Past Events," In addition to predicting future events, BT may provide addi- tional value when it comes to capturing past events. Research has consistently documented human memory limitations associated with retrospectively reporting time spent with various groups and individuals ( Freeman, 1992 ;  Marsden, 1990 ;  Schwarz, 1999 ). Ret- rospective inaccuracies in self-reports have been attributed to several causes, including the use of simplifying heuristics, social desirability biases, demand characteristics, and self-serving attri- butions ( Collopy, 1996 ;  Gosling, John, Craik, & Robins, 1998 ). The objective nature of BT signals helps overcome these biases and, when used in conjunction with self-reports, BT reports of time spent with different groups or individuals in the past may provide incremental validity when it comes to recalling a known criterion from the past. Thus, our fifth and final research question: Research Question 5:  Does Bluetooth-generated data provide incremental validity, above and beyond self-reports, with re- spect to capturing past behavior in a field context? This last question was prompted by a reviewer comment to a previous version of this article, and because it required a “ground truth” score this question was addressed in a different context than what was used for the first four questions. This allowed us to test another recommendation made by  Chaffin et al. (2017)  with respect to single sensor versus multisensor platforms. Specifically,  Chaffin et al. (2017)  made a blanket recommendation that the field of WSTs move away from mul- tisensor platforms that place more than one sensor on a loosely attached device, and instead focus on “single purpose plat- forms” that are optimized around one sensor. There were four reasons for this recommendation. First, it is easier to optimize around one technology than four simultane- ously. Second, when optimized around a single sensor (such as BT), battery life for the platform can be extended far beyond what is required to power four different sensors (especially energy draining microphones). Third, a single purpose BT sensor is far less cumbersome and can be attached in a manner that is far less obtrusive than a platform that needs to capture infrared detections and voice. Finally, the cost of purchasing and processing data from single sensor platforms is far less than what is associated with a multisensor platform. Thus, this second study reports the results from employing a single sensor, low cost, long battery life, wearable BT device. This device was deployed in a context where supervisors of MBA teams observed these teams as part of their formal assignments for the MBA program. This context was heavily covered by cameras and, hence, we were able to obtain ground truth assessments of how much time each supervisor spent with each team and compare this “true score” with both self-reports and BT-generated data. In addition to providing evidence of incremental validity, this al- lowed us to assess the convergence between two different plat- forms for capturing BT signals, thus providing a check on the assumption that BT sensors are standardized commodities and that their data streams should be largely independent of “platform” (i.e., manufacturer) attributes."
Study 1 Method," Research site and sample for Research Questions 1 through 4. The data presented herein were part of a broader data collec- tion effort that took place in the context of an $800 million, large-scale scientific project aimed at building the next generation linear particle accelerator in the United States: the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). Prior to data collection, the research team obtained approval from Michigan State University’s Institutional Review Board (#r050573), with an application titled “Formal and Informal Boundary Spanning in Multiteam Systems: Triadic In- fluences on Knowledge Generation and Innovation in Scientific Teams.” The FRIB is a collaborative effort between the United States Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE-SC) and a large Midwestern university, and is a critical component for scientific initiatives that seek to understand the fundamental forces and particles of nature as manifested in nuclear matter. Scientific research from FRIB will enable the nuclear science community to make discoveries about the properties of rare isotopes (short-lived nuclei not found on Earth) and major advances in the understand- ing of nature by producing isotopes that previously only existed in the most violent conditions in the universe ( York et al., 2009 ). At the time our study was taking place, the linear accelerator was being designed and built by engineers who worked closely with the nuclear scientists who would then use the accelerator for research on rare isotopes. The engineers and scientists were sup- ported by administrative assistants as well as an overarching leadership group that coordinated the efforts of the engineering, scientific, and administrative employees. Our focus was on a large, multifunctional team that was comprised of 32 of the top repre- sentatives of three functional areas (i.e., engineering, scientific, and business support) and leadership. Though all individuals were part of one large team, for ease of exposition we will refer to the groups of functionally distinct employees as “teams” and the larger team, as a whole, as a “multiteam system.” The study took place over 4 weeks and included one major discontinuous event, the groundbreaking at the facility, which was roughly symbolic of the shift from the design stage to the con- struction stage. Typically, the United States Department of Energy commissions a new accelerator every 20 to 25 years. Due to changes in technology over that period, along with the unique focus for each new accelerator, this means that, in the words of FRIB leadership, “This specific accelerator had never been built before and would never be built again.” Thus, this was a knowledge-intensive organization where it was difficult to fully specify in advance exactly who needed to work with whom as the process unfolded. FRIB draws upon the interdisciplinary collab- orative efforts of individuals from a wide variety of occupational specialties. Formal job titles range from generic jobs typically found in almost all organizations, such as “Human Resource Administrator,” “Financial Analyst,” and “Clerical Assistant,” to specialized jobs, such as “Rare Isotope Beam Physicist,” “Dipole Fabrication Specialist,” and “Cryogenic Engineer.” In this study, we used the WST platforms offered by Humanyze (formerly Sociometric Solutions), which was also the platform used in the controlled laboratory studies reported by  Chaffin et al.

At FRIB, we collected data on different days over a 4-week period. Our data collection resulted in nine WST deploy- ment days that we numbered  � 6 to  � 18, reflecting the number of days prior to and after the groundbreaking event. The observation period per participant varied slightly over this time based on on-site attendance patterns (i.e., different work habits and off-site assignments). However, in all cases, we considered the observation period as sufficient to allow true on-site interaction patterns to emerge. Given that these BT sensors perform multiple scans for other BT sensors per minute, the number of observations we obtained across the nine WST deployment days was well into the hundreds of thousands. Bluetooth detections. Over the length of 9 days, the wearable sensors attached to the 32 individuals who were top-level repre- sentatives of the engineering, scientific, business support, and leadership teams detected a total of 220,192 colocation events. We applied a two-step procedure to purge spurious detections from our data. First, we needed to eliminate proximity detections that were not associated with human interaction opportunities. Thus, we restricted our sample to only include records within an RSSI range of  � 69 to  � 91 (with an RSSI of  � 80 in the center). We chose this range as an RSSI of  � 80 has been identified as an appropriate threshold for face-to-face interactions by prior researchers ( Finnerty et al., 2014 ;  Olguin et al., 2009 ), and because the pattern of correlations in the data we collected suggested that the strongest correlations between self-reported variables and RSSI detections were in this range. We interpreted records with RSSI  � � 69 as spurious close- range detections produced in pre- or postdeployment situations after devices were jointly placed on collection carts. We consid- ered records at RSSI  � � 91 to reflect spurious long-range detec- tions indicating a distance of separation that would not constitute an opportunity for human interaction. This restriction reduced our dataset to 205,860 records. Second, we manually searched for and removed records that exhibited improbable detections for the 992 dyads (32  �  31) to enhance data integrity. These detections were those that were generated afterhours, when the BT sensors were in the possession of the research team, likely due to the failure to turn the sensors off upon collection. Ultimately, this resulted in the removal of an additional 3,762 detections (1.7% of total data collected), providing us with a final sample of 202,098 detection records. Figure 1  illustrates the temporal variation of detections across the system. The cumulative number of daily Bluetooth detections range from a minimum of 6,807 on Day  � 6 (i.e., 6 days before groundbreaking) to a maximum of 51,863 on Day  � 16 (i.e., 16 days after groundbreaking).  Figure 2  describes how individuals differ in their proximity to others. The cumulative number of individual Bluetooth detections range from a minimum of 452 to a maximum of 12,556. Figures 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 , and  12  show the cumulative and daily network graphs where blue dots reflect engineers, green dots scientists, black dots business support, and red dots leader- ship.  Figure 3  connects dyads that have 60 or more BT detections over the course of the 9 days within our observed RSSI range ( � 69 to  � 91) based on a force-directed graph drawing algorithm ( Ka- mada & Kawai, 1989 ). We chose 60 BT detections because it represented the median of aggregate detections across all dyads, maximizing the variance in terms of tie presence and absence. Figures 3–12  connects dyads that have seven or more BT detec- tions on that given day using the same algorithm. We chose seven BT detections because the aggregate average count was produced by nine daily observations (60/9  �  6.67). It is important to note that this agnostic algorithm was able to largely group individuals into their respective functional backgrounds (e.g., engineering), such that the physical proximity reflected in the graphs was emer- gent, and not specified in any formal way (i.e., wearable BT data allowed us to detect “known functional groups”). At this point, we provide this data merely to show the structure of the system studied, and how this varied within and between units over time. Measures. Three months prior to the WST deployment, we administered a sociometric survey to obtain self-report data about the nature and strength of relationships among participants. We chose to collect these measures prior to WST deployment, rather than concurrently with WST deployment, not only to reduce par- ticipate fatigue but also because participants typically report on Figure 1. Cumulative daily Bluetooth detections ( � 69  �  RSSI  �  � 91) across 9 deployment days. This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Furthermore, asking participants to report exclusively on their  current  pattern of interactions is apt to be highly problematic as it is often difficult for participants to report on interactions that take place within highly specific time- frames ( Bernard, Killworth, & Sailer, 1981 ). Thus, we asked participants to report on their typical social relations with others. We collected this data following procedures similar to those outlined by  Reagans, Zuckerman, and McEvily (2004) . Due to the large size of the formal organizational network, we used a hybrid fixed roster and free recall method ( Wasserman & Faust, 1994 ). Each respondent was first presented with a list of all FRIB depart- ments and asked to indicate whether they interacted with individ- uals from each department. Next, we presented a fixed roster of all individuals formally assigned to each department, based on the organizational chart. Finally, we provided a free response section for up to 15 additional individuals that the participant could write-in. Thus, our procedures complemented one another such that (a) the fixed roster supplements the free recall questions by ensur- ing that less salient workplace relationships were reported on, and (b) the free-recall questions supplement the fixed roster by ensur- ing that important relationships not captured by the fixed roster were included. As noted, participants reported on friendship and task-related relationships, specifically. Presence and strength were captured for task-related relationships using a 5-point, Likert-type scale where we distinguished between task-related relationships that reflected “advice-giving” versus “advice-receiving.” The pres- ence of friendship relations was captured using a dichotomous variable, which is standard practice in the network literature. Finally, 6 months after WST deployment we obtained perfor- mance ratings for participants from their supervisors. Specifically, job performance was measured using eight items adapted to our context from  Tsui, Pearce, Porter, and Tripoli (1997) . This is a standardized and widely used measure of performance that was specifically designed to be used in contexts where individuals are occupying varied roles. Sample items included the stem “This person,” followed by “is very efficient,” “strives for higher quality work than is required,” “displays effective judgment,” and so on. Supervisors rated their subordinates on a 5-point scale (1  � strongly disagree , 5  �  strongly agree ). Performance ratings were obtained for 31 of the 32 focal participants (96.8%), where the lone missing person was the director of the facility who was not formally evaluated by anyone that was accessible by the research team. The internal consistency estimate of reliability for this scale as operationalized by coefficient alpha was .90. Analyses. Analyses were conducted in Stata 13.1 ( StataCorp, 2013 ), UCInet 6 ( Borgatti, Everett, & Freeman, 2002 ), R statnet ( Handcock, Hunter, Butts, Goodreau, & Morris, 2008 ), and Mplus 6.12 ( Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2011 ). In approaching our first two research questions, where we focused on analyses at the dyadic level of analysis ( n  �  992), we examined BT detections in two ways. Analytic approach to Research Question 1. To address the first research question, convergent validity, we tested the degree to which 992 self-reports of friendship relationships and two kinds of task-related relationships, advice-giving and advice-receiving, cor- related with increasingly liberal ranges of the WST wearer’s cumulative  BT detections. Cumulative BT detections represent the sum of all detections generated at distances up to a particular RSSI “threshold.” For example, at a cumulative RSSI threshold of  � 80 we are including and examining all detections generated at RSSI values (i.e., detection distances) greater than or equal to  � 80, such as  � 79,  � 78,  � 77, and so on, as less negative RSSI values indicate closer distances (i.e., an RSSI of  � 79 indicates a shorter distance than an RSSI of  � 80, while an RSSI of  � 81 indicates a larger distance). This is how BT detections are typically examined in WST literature. We did this not only to examine the conver- gence between self-reported relational variables and BT detec- tions, but also to illustrate the effects of different thresholds on the correlation between cumulative BT detections and self-reported relational variables, as thresholding represents a widespread prac- tice in the burgeoning literature on WSTs.

For example, by using a threshold of RSSI  � � 80, one would remove all BT detections generated at RSSIs of  � 81,  � 82,  � 83, and so on, with the assumption that BT detections registered at these RSSI values indicate distances too great to represent a legitimate interaction. Though the logic un- derlying thresholding may make sense to an engineer, we argue, from a psychometric perspective, that this practice restricts corre- lations and limits one’s ability to predict task-based (i.e., advice) and affective (i.e., friendship) relationships. Thus, in sum, the correlation between cumulative BT detec- tions and sociometric self-reports serves as an indicator of convergent validity. The rationale behind using cumulative BT detections is to illustrate the effect of choosing increasingly inclusive, dichotomous RSSI thresholds (i.e., greater spatial separation), bearing in mind that some researchers have limited themselves to fairly restrictive thresholds (e.g.,  Onnela et al., 2014 ). In doing so we explore the extent to which the use of RSSI thresholds may affect the potential utility of BT sensors. This is of relevance as BT sensors generate detections at a larger range compared to alternative WSTs based on infrared technology ( Chaffin et al., 2017 ). Analytic approach to Research Question 2. To assess the potential of BT data to detect qualitative differences in interac- tions, we shifted our analytical focus from  cumulative  RSSI thresh- olds to  discrete  RSSI levels. This allows us to discriminate be- tween alternative spatial-separation situations. That is, every distinct RSSI value was considered as a separate category or “bin” with the corresponding number of detections. When we look at discrete RSSI levels, we are specifically examining detections registered solely at a particular RSSI value. For example, when we correlate self-reports of friendship with BT detections generated at an RSSI of  � 80, we are including only those BT detections generated at that particular RSSI value (which is indicative of a particular distance). Thus, detections generated at RSSI values Figure 3. Days  � 6 through Day  � 18: Cumulative Bluetooth detections across 9 days.

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 366 MATUSIK ET AL. greater than (e.g.,  � 78,  � 79) or less than (e.g.,  � 81,  � 82)  � 80 are not included in this calculation. The purpose of examining discrete RSSIs is to examine the possibility that BT detections registered at different RSSI values capture different relationship types (i.e., discriminant validity). For example, friends might be expected to stand or sit closer together than colleagues, a pattern that could be reflected in a relatively stronger relationship with a particular RSSI value corresponding to the pair’s preferred interaction distance. Evidence that BT RSSI can be used to discriminate between alternative relationship types would add value to BT sensors as a major limitation associated with WSTs is that they lack contextual information (e.g., does this interaction represent an affective or task-oriented interaction?). Analogous to Research Question #1, we calculated the correlations between BT and self-report data. Recent empirical research on BT proximity sensor data suggests that restricting analyses to close proximity detections improves the correct identification of particular interactions, such as friendship interactions ( Sekara & Lehmann, 2014 ). Thus, to better understand when BT proximity data are particularly effective in predicting certain relationships, we also employed exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) techniques. ERGMs express the probability of a given whole network structure with respect to a set of parame- ters, and are analytically appropriate for modeling the factors driving interdependent dyadic relationships within a social context relative to more traditional estimation approaches that rely on noninterdependence assumptions ( Snijders, Pattison, Robins, & Handcock, 2006 ). In our model specifications, we consider BT detections as a dyad-level exogenous covariate. We then evaluate whether thresholding improves or degrades model fit when it comes to predicting actual self-reported friendship, advice-giving, and advice-receiving networks in a “low information context” (i.e., no knowledge of functional background, such as engineering, leadership, and so on). We then reexamine this same question in a “high information context” that includes additional variables that can be calculated when one has information on functional back- ground. Rather than focus solely on friendship networks ( Sekara & Lehmann, 2014 ), we also examined advice networks to see if Figure 4. Day  � 6. See the online article for the color version of this figure.

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 367 WEARABLE BLUETOOTH SENSORS different conclusions regarding the value of thresholding could be drawn based upon the network in question. Analytic approach to Research Question 3. When examining the criterion-related validity of BT data with respect to individual performance, we shifted the level of analysis from the dyad level to the individual level, where we simply regressed supervisory ratings of performance on the number of BT data-generated bro- kerage opportunities, controlling for aggregated, self-reported friendship, advice-giving, and advice-receiving. Analytic approach to Research Question 4. To decompose variance into within- and between-unit components, we measured two widely used parameters within the network literature and scored individuals on these metrics. These parameters include ego network density and heterogeneity. Ego network density reflects the portion of possible ties among an individual’s direct contacts that are realized and is inversely related to an individual’s broker- age opportunities. On the other hand, heterogeneity is based on the count and proportions of “alter” memberships in different func- tions and reflects the diversity of knowledge resources an individ- ual can access. We calculated  Blau, Blum, and Schwartz’s (1982) measure of heterogeneity as implemented in UCInet ( Borgatti et al., 2002 ). First, we aggregated across the 9 days the study took place and scored individuals via a purely “between units” approach. This would be traditional practice with self-reported network data and one could use this data to infer that a person has greater access to diverse knowledge than another person (i.e., heterogeneity) or that a person has fewer brokerage opportunities than another person (i.e., density), in general. We then treated each daily observation as a meaningful unit and scored individuals in a daily fashion. This allowed us to assess variability within units and created the op- portunity to see if some individuals’ ego networks varied daily (e.g., if individuals are in contact with diverse knowledge on some days but not others). If all the variability existed between units, each person would have the exact same score every day, meaning that there would be zero within-unit variance  across days. In other words, all the graphs depicted in  Figures 3–12  would be identical. On the other Figure 5. Day  � 4. See the online article for the color version of this figure.

Neither of these extremes is likely and, thus, this total variance can be decomposed into within and between components that sum to 1.00. To establish if variance within units is indeed systematic and not simply random error, we then factor analyzed the dyadic network data to see if the interaction patterns were systematic and related to known changes in the nature of the work conducted in the orga- nization. More specifically, we wanted to see if the factors that emerged were representative of distinct activity states before and after the official groundbreaking ceremony. In this factor analysis, the rows reflect dichotomous (0, 1) determinations as to whether any two people were linked on the day in question, and the columns reflect the 9 days where people could have possibly been linked. Thus, if Person #1 was linked to Person #2 on Day  � 6, this value would be 1 for that pair on that day. If Person #1 was not linked to Person #3 on that day, that value would be 0. Thus, the matrix that was factor analyzed contained 992 rows, one for each dyad, and nine columns, one for each day. If the variance within dyads was due to random error, then no strong factors would emerge from this analysis. However, if there were systematically recurring interactions (e.g., Person #1 was linked to Person #2 most of the days, but rarely was linked to Person #3) these recurring interactions would be reflected in a single overarching factor that would capture this systematic variance. That is, if the pattern of interactions across dyads was systematic and stable across time, then one general factor would emerge from this “Dyad  �  Day” matrix that would reflect, in general, whom was systematically linked to whom. However, if systematic interaction patterns varied by day, such as before or after the groundbreaking, then this would mean that there were systematic interaction patterns that varied over time. So, for example, Person #1 may have had one set of systematic interaction patterns  before  the groundbreaking, but then had a different, but still systematic, set of interaction patterns  after  the groundbreaking.

Results," Over the 3-week, 15-session period, 67,508 BT detections were generated among the four base stations and nine supervisors. Of these, 55,915 were between the four base stations and 10,774 occurred between supervisors and base stations. The remaining 819 detections were generated between BT-equipped supervisors, and therefore were not included in our analyses. As stated, we needed to determine an appropriate maximum RSSI that would suggest that supervisors were still in the presence of a given base station, and we used the 55,915 detections among the base stations to determine this maximum RSSI. Specifically, we used the aver- age RSSI at which base stations detected one another to identify colocation events, with the logic that if a focal BT base station in one room can detect the BT base station in another room at a particular RSSI level, then the focal base station should also detect BT-equipped supervisors in this other room at that RSSI level. On average, the four base stations detected one another at an RSSI value of  � 60.08. Thus, we removed all detections from the 10,774 detections between supervisors and base stations that were less than  � 60 (i.e., greater than  � 60 in absolute value). This resulted in a sample of 5,934 BT detections between supervisors and base stations. At this point, we calculated the number of seconds between consecutive detections of each supervisor in each location. That is, we used the timestamps of each BT detection to determine how much time had passed since a given base station (e.g., Room A’s base station) had detected the BT sensor of each supervisor, as well as how much time had passed since a given supervisor sensor had detected each base station. Because the BT sensors used in this study swept for other BT sensors in 10-s intervals, we then aggregated the time each supervisor’s wearable BT sensor ap- peared to be continuously collocated with a base station BT sensor in the rooms assigned to each team during each session. After aggregation our sample encompassed 168 observations, or two observations per supervisor-base station dyad—one for the super- visor’s BT sensor detections of the base station, and one for the base station’s BT sensor detections of the supervisor. We averaged these two observations to assess the time supervisors were with each team in each room (i.e.,  n  �  84). Finally, we correlated the total number of minutes derived from our calculations with the number of minutes reported by team supervisors and video coders.  Table 11  provides descriptive sta- tistics of and correlations between (a) supervisors’ self-reports, (b) minutes inferred form BT-generated data, and (c) coded video data (averaged between the two coders).

BT sensor data demonstrated a very similar and strong correlation with the coded video data,  r  �  .63 ( p  �  .01). Most importantly, when included in a multiple regression predicting coded video data, both self-reports ( � �  .47,  p  �  .01) and BT sensor data ( � �  .46,  p  �  .01) uniquely predicted variance, with an  R 2   of .58. When BT sensor data was added in a second step, rather than in a single step with self-reports (i.e., hierarchical regression),  R 2   increased by .18 ( p  �  .05). Thus, we conclude that BT-generated data not only detects known colo- cation with a high level of accuracy but may also be used as a valuable supplement to self-reports given its ability to predict incremental variance in time spent interacting with teams in spe- cific locations."
Study 2," Although the BT-generated data in the first study demonstrated convergent validity with self-reported relational data (e.g., friend- ship), the sole reliance on self-reports may raise concerns given the aforementioned issues often associated with them. That is, al- though the laboratory studies reported by  Chaffin et al. (2017) employed known true scores, this was not the case in any of the analyses used to address the first four of our research questions. Furthermore, the value of BT sensors would be enhanced if em- pirical evidence suggested that they could indeed capture interac- tions that self-reports would miss. Thus, we conducted a second study in a heavily monitored field setting. In this study, we examined the extent to which wearable BT sensors could provide incremental validity when it comes to recalling the amount of time team supervisors spent interacting with different teams for whom they were responsible in a context where we had known scores, captured by video (i.e., ground truth)."
Method," Research site and sample for Research Question 5. Our second study took place in a laboratory suite on the campus of a large Midwestern university where the research participants worked as team supervisors. The laboratory suite consisted of four rooms: Rooms A, B, and C, and a main room that connected the three lettered rooms.  Figure 13  provides a visualization of the suite’s physical layout. Three teams at a time worked on a team- based simulation in one of the three lettered rooms, while the main room was used for introductions, debriefing, and interactions among supervisors during the simulation. Once per week, over the course of 3 weeks, 15 teams came to the lab and completed three simulations. Given the capacity of the lab (i.e., three teams at a time) and the number of iterations that each team engaged in (i.e., three iterations each), there were a total of 45 simulations run over the course of 15 lab sessions (i.e., five sessions per week over the 3-week period, three teams per ses- sion). During each session, teams were observed by various team supervisors who worked for the MBA program. In total, nine supervisors observed, interacted with, and engaged in instructional material with these teams. Some supervisors came to as few as a single session, whereas others came to as many as six sessions. Collectively, these nine supervisors attended 26 sessions as more than one supervisor could observe the simulation at once. Each time supervisors attended a session, they were equipped with a wearable BT sensor. Furthermore, additional BT sensors were planted throughout the suite in the locations that supervisors tended to congregate: just inside the doors of the four rooms. These planted BT sensors served as “base stations,” and were used to determine the amount of time that supervisors spent in each of the four rooms (i.e., with each team). Given that the nine supervisors collectively attended 26 sessions, and that each session involved teams that the supervisor might interact with (the three MBA teams and the instructional team) in various locations (i.e., Rooms A, B, C, or the main room), we had a total of 104 (26  �  4) possible person-team dyads. However, due to software malfunctions, our final sample consisted of 84 person-team dyads (80.77%). Each session was videotaped and independently coded by one graduate student and one undergraduate student. Coders kept a record of the number of minutes that each of the nine supervisors met with each of the four teams (i.e., the three MBA teams and the Figure 13.

Agreement among video coders was extremely high, with an ICC(1) of .97 and an ICC(2) of .98, far surpassing acceptable levels ( Bliese, 2000 ;  James, 1982 ). Thus, we averaged the two coders’ ratings and treated this as ground truth to be predicted with BT-generated data and supervisors’ self-reports. Bluetooth sensors. The BT sensor data used in Study 1 was captured using the Humanyze device, a multisensor platform. Following the recommendation of  Chaffin et al. (2017) , we mi- grated from the multisensor platform used in Study 1 to a single- sensor BT device offered by Limefy. This device uses less energy to capture BT signals and is not configured as adjacent to any other sensors (such as microphones or accelerometers), as is the case with the Humanyze platform. To ensure that the two WSTs were comparable in their ability to measure variability in distance based on BT signal strength, we conducted a prevalidation experiment in a barrier-free environ- ment, varying the distance between each device (ranging from approximately 1 m to 8 m). The position of each device was marked so that the placement was consistent across sensor plat- forms and multiple iterations. Each device was then left in a static position for a period of 45 min in our experimental setting. It is important to note that the correlation between BT RSSI and increasing distances should be negative because RSSI should decrease (i.e., become more negative) as distance increases (i.e., becomes larger). The correlation between actual distance and the RSSI values recorded by (a) the Humanyze BT sensors was  r  � � .55 ( p  �  .01) and (b) the Limefy BT sensors was  r  � � .72 ( p  �  .01). These results demonstrate the validity of BT signal strength detections in terms of differentiating distances between sensor locations. Addi- tionally, the relationship between the signal strength of the two devices (based on the location each sensor was placed) was  r  �  .67 ( p  �  .01), providing evidence of convergence between the two devices. Given that the BT sensors on the two devices differenti- ated distance and correlated highly with one another, we migrated to the single-sensor Limefy platform. Measures. Two weeks after these sessions took place, the nine supervisors reported the amount of time that they had spent interacting with various teams in the four rooms of the suite during the sessions they attended. To facilitate the supervisors’ memories, they were given a very precise amount of time to allocate among the rooms/teams, such that the amount of time they allocated corresponded to the number of minutes captured by the video camera (and consequently coded by coders). Furthermore, they were given specific information about which teams were in which rooms (as each supervisor had primary responsibility for specific teams), the time at which labs began and ended, and the dates of each session, along with a diagram of the room. Thus, these conditions were quite favorable for the supervisors in terms of recall, and perhaps much more structured relative to what one might see in a less structured organizational context, hence pro- viding an upper bound for the human ratings. In contrast, the small space of the suite and short distance between BT base stations made this a challenging context for the BT sensors. Analytic approach. As noted, BT sensors were placed in the four rooms in locations where supervisors tended to congregate. These sensors served as base stations and swept for other BT sensors every 10 s. Thus, they were what we used to infer that supervisors were with various teams. Furthermore, these base stations were used to determine the RSSI level at which detections were not meaningful. Specifically, we used the average RSSI at which these base stations detected one another (i.e., detected BT sensors in other rooms) to determine the RSSI at which we removed detections. Although we do not endorse threshold-based logic when using BT sensors to capture interactions among indi- viduals, we felt it was appropriate in this context given the small size of the suite, how closely the base stations were situated to one another, the static positioning of the base stations, and the fact that we were attempting to determine time spent in specific locations (rather than detect human interactions)."
Discussion," Over the last few years, wearable sensors have been subject to rapid technological progress and wide-spread diffusion in the form of consumer electronics (e.g., fitness bands, mobile phones). Every day, WSTs become more diverse (e.g., smart contact lenses), less intrusive (i.e., advances in miniaturization and energy efficiency), and more affordable. As WST communication interfaces become standardized, practitioners and organizational researchers will have the opportunity to build affordable, custom, wearable mea- surement systems to collect longitudinal, high-resolution data on human interaction in both laboratory and field settings. The overall objective of this research was to provide construct validation evidence for the use of wearable BT sensors in assessing relational variables. To do so we examined the construct validity and utility of wearable BT sensor data in two studies. The results from our first study demonstrated that BT-generated proximity data correlates with traditional self-reported survey data, specifically self-reported friendship and task-based relationships. As noted earlier,  Eagle et al. (2009)  observed correlations between self-reported proximity and BT data that ranged from  r  �  .16 to r  �  .41, which are comparable to cross-method correlations ob- served for psychological constructs (e.g.,  Meyer et al., 2001 ) and our own findings. Overall, it seems that the evidence for conver- gent validity in the present study is favorable, and that thresholding does impact the level of convergence. This study also provided some evidence that BT data are sen- sitive to the types of interactions that take place. We find that treating BT radio signal strength data as a continuous variable may add value as it could allow researchers to differentiate between different relationships (e.g., friendship, advice-giving, and advice- receiving). Our results suggest that the BT RSSI profile for inter- actions associated with an affective relationship (i.e., friendship) may be different from that produced by purely task-related ex- changes (i.e., advice) as the interactions of the former seem to occur at closer distances. The key contribution here is that con- ventional approaches to BT RSSIs, which involve a threshold- based logic that (a) treats all detections above or below a particular RSSI threshold as the same and (b) provides a simple count of detections, fails to realize the full psychometric potential of BT data. Therefore, organizational researchers should consider ana- lyzing full proximity profiles rather than binary detection counts. Part three of this first study assessed the ability of BT data to predict individual job performance. The results from this portion of the study suggest that brokerage, a commonly studied network variable, can be measured via BT-generated data and used to predict future performance in contexts where brokerage is critical. In the context of our study, a knowledge-intensive multiteam system working on the implementation of a large scientific instal- lation, brokerage  is  critical and, therefore, its relationship with performance should be evident if the sensors are valid indicators of brokerage. Thus, part three of our study provides evidence that BT-generated data may allow researchers to calculate network variables that contribute to their ability to predict important work- place outcomes. The fourth part of our first study concentrated on the potential of BT data to decompose variance in individual-level network vari- ables and capture systematic changes in interaction patterns. The period over which we collected our data was characterized by a major, discontinuous event that provided us with a natural, quasi- experimental research setting. This discontinuous event emerged in our exploratory factor analysis and illustrated how high- resolution temporal data generated by wearable BT sensors could enhance our understanding of organizational dynamics. Thus, Part 4 of our first study provides two important contributions. First, we discovered that a majority of variance in two ego network vari- ables lies within-person (or unit) rather than between-persons (or units). Traditional methods for assessing networks make it a prac- tical impossibility to explore such intraindividual (unit) variability in these constructs, and thus WSTs have the potential to open entirely new lines of research. For example, most network data are collected at one point in time and, consequently, extant research is dominated by  static  logics of structural constraint. However, con- tinuously collected network data can move research toward a dynamic  perspective and foster the generation of new insights into individual-level agency, dyad-level stability, and network-level periodicity (i.e., regularity and duration of representative activity states). Second, and relatedly, WSTs allow researchers to examine systematic changes in interaction patterns, as evidenced by the results from our factor analysis. Future research may use WSTs to examine changes in network activity over longer time periods to produce even finer-grained interaction patterns and interaction modes. Finally, our second study, conducted in a heavily monitored field setting, demonstrated that BT-generated data correlated highly with videotaped, coded interactions. It should be noted that we tried to facilitate a high correlation between self-reports and this coded video data (i.e., ground truth), and determined that BT data correlated just as strongly with the coded video data as these facilitated self-reports. This study demonstrates that BT-generated data can be used to predict unique variance in known locations, Table 11 Correlations Between Time Spent in Suite Locations Implied by Team Supervisors’ Self-Reports, Video Coding, and BT Sensors Variables Mean SD (1) (2) Video coding 19.86 15.70 Self-reports 22.87 15.76 .64 BT sensors 07.04 10.63 .63 .36 Note . n  �  84 (person-team dyads).

Recommendations and Best Practices," Several recommendations may be derived from the findings of our work, as well as our personal experiences working with this technology. Like  Chaffin et al. (2017) , many of our recommenda- tions center on planning and conducting a WST-based study. However, several additional recommendations, beyond those of- fered by  Chaffin et al. (2017) , can be gleaned from our work, particularly as it pertains to data analysis, exploration, and inter- pretation. Prior to WST deployment. There are several steps we rec- ommend researchers and practitioners engage in before commenc- ing data collection. First, we recommend that individuals pretest the actual sensors they intend to use in a controlled environment prior to deploying them in the field. In our second study, some of our sensors suffered from software malfunctions, which resulted in a loss of data. Although we retained approximately 80% of our data, which still corresponds to a relatively favorable “response rate,” a benefit of WSTs is that they can facilitate the collection of longitudinal interaction data and the loss of any such data is unfortunate. Second, we advise researchers to focus on the measurement technology (BT) itself, rather than strictly the measurement tool (i.e., brand), when choosing a WST. Herein, we focused on BT per Chaffin et al.’s (2017)  suggestions, and we examined convergence between two different BT sensors as we used Humanyze sensors in our first study and Limefy sensors in our second study. Our results suggest that BT is a useful technology and may represent a valid data collection instrument across manufacturers. However, when choosing a BT-based wearable measurement tool, researchers need to carefully evaluate how different system and component archi- tectures might affect the fidelity of the BT signal. Third, we recommend that researchers and practitioners set up and stick to a reliable, consistent deployment schedule. As noted, BT records consist of sender and receiver identifiers (i.e., identi- fication numbers). Thus, assigning and consistently attaching spe- cific wearable sensors to specific individuals eases the examina- tion of interaction patterns across several days while also minimizing human errors associated with the matching of sender and receiver identifiers with participant identification numbers. Fourth, researchers and practitioners should attempt to distin- guish and understand the various relationships that exist among participants and employees. The results of our discriminant valid- ity analyses (i.e., the correlations between discrete BT RSSI values and self-reported variables,  Table 2 ) as well as our QAP correla- tions suggest that (a) different types of relationships may be reflected in more frequent interactions at certain RSSI levels; (b) the prediction of various types of relationships may be differen- tially affected by the use of thresholding; and (c) different rela- tionships and networks, though potentially correlated, are suffi- ciently distinct to warrant individual attention (given our QAP correlations between friendship and advice-giving networks [ r  � .43] and friendship and advice-receiving networks [ r  �  .37]). Fifth, although we recommend the use of self-report scales consistent with the conceptualization of the variables they are meant to capture, the use of dichotomous scales may attenuate the correlations one obtains when examining the convergence between self-report measures and BT-generated detections due to range restriction. As previously noted, the correlation between BT de- tections and self-reported friendship may have been attenuated given the dichotomous nature of the friendship scale. For example, in our analyses examining discrete RSSI values the peak correla- tion between friendship and BT detections was  r  �  .35 at an RSSI of  � 76. However, the use of a biserial correlation (not a  point biserial correlation), which assumes a continuous distribution un- derlying the dichotomous variable ( Cohen et al., 2003 ), increased this value to  r b  �  .54. To avoid confusion regarding convergence between self-reports and BT detections in future validation efforts (which we encourage), it is best to be consistent in the format one uses to collect self-report measures or, when it is necessary to use varying scale formats, correct and account for potential range restriction. Finally, and related to our last recommendation, it is possible that the lower correlations we obtained between friendship and BT detections, relative to the correlations obtained between advice receiving/giving and BT detections, is partially attributable to the more psychological nature of the friendship construct. Indeed, some constructs are more behavioral and observable than others, meaning that they can be more easily perceived and detected ( Carter, Carter, & DeChurch, 2018 ). Friendship is arguably more psychological and less observable than advice giving and receiving as the acts of giving and receiving advice represent overt behaviors that can be readily discerned and, hypothetically, more easily detected by WSTs. That is, WSTs such as BT may be more appropriate for detecting relatively behavioral phenomena as they are capable of capturing observable interaction patterns. We rec- ommend that future researchers not only test this proposition but also consider this as a possibility in the selection of the constructs they ultimately choose to study. During WST deployment. There are also several strategies that researchers and practitioners can use during WST deployment to ensure the success of their efforts. First, echoing suggestions made by  Chaffin et al. (2017) , we recommend that individuals deploy WSTs over a relatively long window of observation. As noted, BT sensors generate detections that adhere to a Gaussian distribution ( Ramadurai & Sichitiu, 2003 ;  Sichitiu & Ramadurai, 2004 ), and therefore collecting observations over an extended period allows the random error associated with single BT detec- tions to cancel out over time, thus facilitating the emergence of a “true” RSSI value. Second, and particularly relevant to field settings, we recom- mend that researchers remain vigilant and catalog known changes in their research environment. Our context was characterized by a known, major transition in network activity states, namely ground- breaking (i.e., Day 0). Knowledge of this critical transition facil- itated our efforts in interpreting the visible changes in our network graphs ( Figures 3–12 ). As a result, we were able to illustrate how BT-generated data can be analyzed to reflect structural regularities in network activity states, opening conceptual and empirical re- search opportunities largely unavailable with survey-based data collection strategies. Finally, we recommend that researchers and practitioners do what they can to promote wearer compliance. Compliance issues, and associated missing data, can rapidly erode data quality as well as the integrity of one’s results. Indeed, many important network This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 382 MATUSIK ET AL. statistics are disproportionately sensitive to missing data due the interdependence of relational data. Furthermore, the high-powered empirics associated with the impressive number of detections generated by WSTs are likely to amplify the potential impact of missing data, leading to spurious findings that inaccurately reflect relationships and interactions among individuals. Granted, we must balance personal privacy with our desire for complete data, but the communication of well-intentioned, scientifically oriented motivation to participants could help (as well as the guaranteed anonymization of data, postdata collection). After WST deployment. Where our recommended practices deviate most from those provided by  Chaffin et al. (2017)  is in the processing, exploration, and analysis of data, given our field con- texts. First, in the processing of data, we recommend that research- ers avoid using preset RSSI thresholds to determine which detec- tions represent “meaningful” interaction opportunities and which detections do not (i.e., which detections represent distances too great to constitute an interaction opportunity). The results address- ing our first research question (see  Table 1 ), that is, BT’s conver- gence with self-reported relational measures, suggest that the high- est convergence between BT-generated data and self-reports of relational measures occur at RSSI thresholds greater than the recommended  � 80 ( Olguin et al., 2009 ). Relatedly, the results of all our ERGM analyses indicate that thresholding does not enhance our ability to predict either advice-oriented or friendship relation- ships, regardless of whether we included information pertaining to the formal organizational structure (i.e., functional background), given increases in AICs and BICs. Perhaps there are research contexts in which thresholding makes practical and/or theoretical sense (e.g., in small laboratory suites where the outcome of interest is time spent in specific locations), but blindly utilizing an RSSI threshold based upon precedent or common practice is problematic as it may limit one’s ability to predict outcomes of interest. Second, and similarly related to the processing of data, we recommend that researchers and practitioners screen for outliers within their registered BT detections. That is, researchers and practitioners should ensure that their WST-generated data are realistic by examining the detection records themselves. For ex- ample, and as previously noted, we discovered and purged detec- tions that represented improbable interactions based upon the timestamp of the detection record. In total, we removed 3,762 detections (1.7% of all data generated) as these detections were generated afterhours, when the sensors were in the possession of the research team. This was likely due to participants failing to turn the sensors off or inadvertent activation after they were collected. Inclusion of these detections could have led us to misguided conclusions, and thus it was necessary to purge them. Although this may seem just common sense, our point is to remember that humans (both research participants and research assistants) are error-prone, and this is something that could easily be lost when getting caught up in processing the “big data” that is collected by WSTs. Third, we recommend that researchers and practitioners take a somewhat exploratory approach to their data analysis when it comes to WST data. As noted, we are still at the validation stage with this technology and, thus, there is still much to learn before we engage in significant substantive research. Open-mindedness with, and exploration of, WST-generated data may provide in- sights that might be missed by a researcher heavily focused on an initial plan. For example, we discovered that detections at stronger (i.e., less negative) RSSI values are more highly correlated with self-reports of friendship than self-reports of advice-giving and receiving (see  Table 2 ). This means that more frequent BT detec- tions registered at RSSI values indicating closer proximity (e.g.,  � 76) may serve as an indicator of a friendship relationship between two individuals whereas frequent BT detections regis- tered at RSSI values indicating further proximity (e.g.,  � 83) may serve as a better indicator of an advice-based relationship between two colleagues. Relatedly, we recommend examining WST data at various lev- els of analysis, including the dyadic, individual, and whole net- work levels of analysis, as we did in this investigation. Organiza- tions are inherently multilevel entities ( Kozlowski & Klein, 2000 ) and, thus, the exploration of WST-generated data at each level represents a unique opportunity to evaluate its potential to con- tribute to future research. Similarly, though perhaps more related to the planning of the project, we do not yet know what observa- tion window is appropriate for capturing a particular organiza- tional phenomenon or event. In our first study, we used an obser- vation window of several days spanning a major organizational event (i.e., groundbreaking). However, other researchers may find that a shorter (i.e., several hours) or longer (i.e., several months) observation window is sufficient and/or necessary given their phenomenon or level of interest; the appropriate observation win- dow may vary with the level at which the phenomenon of interest resides (i.e., dyadic, individual, or whole network level). Thus, we recommend that researchers identify and use a theoretical logic to drive their approach. Fourth, we recommend that researchers and practitioners use this data to generate widely studied network measures such as brokerage. These measures are not only more objective than those derived from surveys but may also predict outcomes of practical interest (i.e., performance). Indeed, our BT-generated brokerage variable predicted individual performance above and beyond self- reported measures of advice-giving, advice-receiving, and friend- ship, despite a relatively small sample size ( n  �  31 at the individ- ual level of analysis). Future researchers should use BT-generated network variables to predict outcomes of interest, examine poten- tial antecedents and consequences of these objective network measures, and assess their convergence with and divergence from self-reported measures of network variables (i.e., Are the anteced- ents of network variables identified in survey research also pre- dictive of network variables derived from BT detections?). Fifth, and finally, researchers and practitioners should examine variance  in BT-generated network measures, ensuring that the observation window over which they collect their data (i.e., hours, days, months) corresponds, theoretically, to their phenomenon of interest (you miss the variance you do not capture). The results of our variance decomposition of network measures at the individual level of analysis suggested that a majority of variance resides within individuals rather than between individuals. When it comes to conceptualizing one’s position in the network, researchers have been unable to explore the extent to which any one person’s position in a network is contingent upon the work configuration associated with different days due to the limitations of self- reported network data, and we find that a great deal of variance is lost by aggregating to a composite level (i.e., across all 9 days of data collection in Study 1). We have emphasized before, and feel This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 383 WEARABLE BLUETOOTH SENSORS the need to emphasize again, that no prior organizational study has been able to examine “daily networks” like this, and, hence, extant research may be missing where the majority of variance lies in network structures. Thus, the use of WSTs may not only open entirely new lines of research but may revolutionize our under- standing of networks altogether."
Limitations," The findings and implications of this study should be interpreted with its limitations in mind. The most notable limitations associ- ated with this research are (a) the unique nature of the research contexts and (b) the relatively small number of participants. How- ever, these samples were chosen for two reasons. First, the work context and specialization of the participants in the first study facilitated a high level of interaction and task interdependence, which ensured a large number of BT detections. In terms of the second study, the small number of participants allowed us to monitor and accurately code videotaped interactions between su- pervisors and teams, which allowed us to maximize correlations between self-reports, BT data, and coded video data. Second, and relatedly, the use of BT sensors in organizational research is nascent and, thus, we were required to restrict the number of participants to a manageable size. Future developments of WSTs may alleviate some of the logistical demands involved in their deployment. Another potential concern with this study is that the instability of RSSI can make it difficult to establish a definite relationship between distance and RSSI ( Heurtefeux & Valois, 2012 ). How- ever, it is important to reemphasize that we collected data for relatively long periods of time in both studies (i.e., several weeks), in settings where tasks were highly interdependent across func- tional backgrounds (Study 1) and physical locations (Study 2). Accordingly, the large number of BT detections we obtained should enable us to leverage this imperfect measure to approxi- mate actual proximity. In support of this, prior researchers dem- onstrated that RSSI can be used as a distance measurement in various indoor and outdoor locations ( Eagle et al., 2009 ;  Kumar, Reddy, & Varma, 2009 ;  Liu, Jiang, & Striegel, 2014 ;  Naya, Noma, Ohmura, & Kogure, 2005 ;  Zhang, Zhang, Ying, & Gao, 2009 ). Additionally, we cannot say with absolute certainty that the validity evidence we present here will generalize to all other relationship and network types, or to other constructs typically examined with a network lens. What we provided was initial evidence that, over extended observation periods in field settings, BT-sensor generated proximity data could potentially help re- searchers and practitioners identify and discriminate between friendship and task-based relationships (i.e., advice relationships), as well as detect (a) major transitions in network activity states, (b) time spent by individuals in various locations, and (c) interactions among organizational actors, more generally. We did not provide evidence that BT sensors can be used to identify relationships in alternative, specific networks (e.g., developmental and knowledge networks;  Dobrow, Chandler, Murphy, & Kram, 2012 ;  Phelps et al., 2012 ), nor did we provide evidence that BT sensors may be used to capture all constructs that may be examined with a network lens, such as social capital ( Li, 2013 ) and trust ( Ferrin, Dirks, & Shah, 2006 ). We cannot assume that the validation evidence that we provide herein will generalize to all alternative networks and constructs (and their associated interaction patterns), and we do not yet know what constitutes an appropriate BT data collection period for the discrimination among various relationship types. Therefore, much more validation work needs to be done by psychologists before we can definitively say that BT sensor data reflects specific psycho- logical constructs not examined here (e.g., trust, distrust) as well as those examined here (i.e., friendship, advice-oriented relation- ships). That is, future research should not only attempt to replicate the validation evidence we provide (i.e., BT data’s validity with respect to friendship, advice-oriented relationships, and interac- tions, more generally) but also attempt to validate BT sensors in contexts associated with alternative types of networks and rela- tionships. Finally, and given the evidence on individual and whole net- work variability presented herein, one may be concerned that there was a 3-month gap between the collection of self-reported friend- ship, advice-giving, and advice-receiving and the collection of BT detections in Study 1. Specifically, one may be concerned that the networks captured by the BT data and the networks captured by self-reports represent notably different networks given our evi- dence that networks vary and evolve over time. Although there may be some degradation in convergent, discriminant, and predic- tive validity attributable to the temporal delay, the level of this degradation did not prevent us from obtaining statistically signif- icant results. Nevertheless, future research should attempt to cap- ture self-reports and BT data closer together in time, not only to see whether stronger effects can be obtained (as measurements closer together in time should, presumably, result in stronger correlations than those we obtained) but also to document the potential degradation associated with increasingly larger time lags (e.g., Is the correlation between self-reported relationships and BT-generated data greater as the time lag decreases? By how much does the correlation decrease as the lag increases?). Though this may be somewhat difficult considering the labor intensive nature of the repeated collection of network surveys and the inaccuracies associated with participant recall of instances of interaction during specific timeframes ( Freeman, 1992 ;  Marsden, 1990 ), findings that speak to the degradation of convergent validity resulting from increasingly large time lags would be both informative and sup- portive of our arguments regarding network variability and, relat- edly, evolution."
Conclusion," When one considers how social and behavioral scientists seem to readily adopt new technologies (i.e., e-mail, social media plat- forms, panoramic cameras), it seems inevitable that the use of WSTs will someday become routine practice. Although we are still far from that day, as market forces and scientific progress continue to facilitate the development of these technologies social and behavioral scientists should look for opportunities to exploit the increased connectedness and granularity that WSTs have to offer. In an effort to speed the arrival of that day, the present investiga- tion represents the first attempt to perform a traditional psycho- metric construct validation study that assesses the utility of WST- generated data (i.e., Bluetooth), with an emphasis on how it can be used to leverage and contribute to the extant knowledge base.
