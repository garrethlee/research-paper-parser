Introduction," Starting from Cyert and March ’ s (1963) seminal book, organizational scholars have accu- mulated a considerable body of work that documents the in ﬂ uence of performance in relation to an aspiration level on a wide range of organizational responses. Although multiple goals are a permanent  ﬁ xture of organizations (Ethiraj & Levinthal, 2009; Levinthal & Rerup, 2021), the preponderance of work on the in ﬂ uence of performance on organizational responses bypassed this critical aspect of organizations by assuming that decision-makers pick a particular (typically  ﬁ nancial) goal to focus their attention on and then stick to such an orientation (Cyert & March, 1963; Greve, 2008). Studies of the impact of return on assets (ROA) are the most prominent example of this research approach (see, Posen, Keil, Kim, & Meissner, 2018 for a review). It is only recently that we are witnessing a gradual shift toward the examination of the in ﬂ uence of multiple goals, and particularly of situations where performance on such goals diverges, thus leaving open different possible interpreta- tions of overall performance (e.g., Audia & Greve, 2021; Gaba & Greve, 2019; Hu & Bettis, 2018; Mazzelli, Nason, De Massis, & Kotlar, 2019). More importantly, the limited research on multiple goals has examined search intensity as the focal response, ignoring that search may occur in different locations. The goal of this study is, therefore, to contribute to this body of work by examining the in ﬂ uence of performance on multiple goals on search, a central concept in research on the effect of performance on organizational behavior (Greve, 2003b), and, in particular, the locus of search (i.e., local vs. distal search). Single-goal studies of performance and search have focused on Research and Development (R&D) intensity as a proxy for search, with the key prediction and  ﬁ nding being that low performance on a primary goal such as ROA increases R&D intensity and thus evidences an increase in overall search (Chen, 2008; Greve, 2003a; Lucas, Knoben, & Meeus, 2018; O ’ Brien & David, 2014). Other studies exam- ining multiple goals (Audia & Brion, 2007; Kostopoulos, Syrigos, & Kuusela, 2023) suggest that, when performance is low on a primary goal but high on a secondary goal, organizations may not increase the intensity of search activities as predicted by Cyert and March (1963). Yet, pertinent literature is silent about the in ﬂ uence of this type of inconsistent performance 2 Journal of Management regarding multiple goals on how organizations regulate the locus of search decisions and, in particular, their propensity to engage in (more or less) distal search. Distal search is of critical importance to organizations and has been extensively examined in the technological literature (Laursen, 2012). An organization may search more or may search less, but the search that it initiates may take place in the proximity of familiar technological areas or inside the organi- zation (i.e., local search) or, alternatively, may occur in unknown technological areas or outside the organization (i.e., distal search). In this study, therefore, we extend previous work on multiple goals by addressing the following questions: Does low performance on a primary goal lead to an increase in distal search? Does high performance on a secondary goal, when performance on a primary goal is also low, reduce distal search? To address these research questions, we integrate insights from the original formulation of the behavioral theory of the  ﬁ rm (BTOF) laid out by Cyert and March (1963) and later elab- orations that give greater emphasis to the in ﬂ uence of multiple goals (e.g., Audia & Greve, 2021; Gaba & Greve, 2019; Hu & Bettis, 2018). A long-held assumption rooted in Cyert and March (1963) is that boundedly rational decision-makers oriented to problem-solving handle the cognitive demands that stem from multiple goals by sequentially allocating atten- tion, focusing  ﬁ rst exclusively on primary goals that are highest in a hierarchy of importance and then moving down the goal hierarchy (i.e., to secondary goals), as the goal that has higher importance is met. Drawing upon this perspective, in our  ﬁ rst hypothesis, we argue that orga- nizations will respond with more distal search (Baum, Rowley, Shipilov, & Chuang, 2005) when performance on a primary goal is below the aspiration level, while performance on a secondary goal does not in ﬂ uence where (locally or distally) search is conducted unless per- formance on the primary goal is satisfactory. However, later theorizing that focuses on multiple goals points to a contrasting scenario. When decision-makers experience multiple goals of unequal importance, they may self- enhance (Audia & Brion, 2007) and focus their attention on the goals that show positive out- comes, irrespective of whether they are the most important. Prior related research (Kostopoulos et al., 2023) has argued that when performance on a primary goal is low, performance on a sec- ondary goal that exceeds an aspiration level leads to a reduction in the intensity of search activ- ities. We add a new insight, namely that the propensity to self-enhance, enabled by the ambiguity that arises when performance on a secondary goal is high and performance on a primary goal is low, will manifest itself also in important locus of search choices. Speci ﬁ cally, we argue that decision-makers who are motivated to self-enhance prefer to direct search in more familiar technological areas and to keep search internal to the organization, as such search reinforces trust in their previous choices and skills and, thus, supports their pos- itive self-image. They shy away from searching in unfamiliar areas or outside the organization because these two forms of distal search can be perceived as casting doubt on their ability to generate plausible solutions with their current set of knowledge and skills. We examine the in ﬂ uence of performance on multiple goals on distal search using a unique sample of global incumbent pharmaceutical  ﬁ rms with a portfolio of clinical trials regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the period 1993 to 2021. Speci ﬁ cally, we examine how decision-makers respond to portfolio-level performance feed- back regarding multiple stages of the clinical trials process. We found that, taken by itself, performance relative to aspirations on a primary goal in ﬂ uences a  ﬁ rm ’ s propensity to search distally along two independent dimensions: the technological dimension, which Keil et al. / (In)Consistent Performance Feedback and the Locus of Search 3 refers to familiarity with the  ﬁ rm ’ s technological areas, and the organizational dimension, which refers to knowledge and expertise located within or outside the  ﬁ rm (Rosenkopf & Nerkar, 2001; Rothaermel & Alexandre, 2009). Speci ﬁ cally, when the rate of successful late- stage clinical trials (the primary goal) is below aspirations,  ﬁ rms increase their propensity to select drug candidates targeted at disease areas that are unfamiliar to the  ﬁ rm as well as drug candidates from outside the  ﬁ rm. However, consistent with our prediction, our  ﬁ ndings also indicate that when above-aspiration performance on a secondary goal (i.e., the rate of success- ful early-stage clinical trials) is considered, this pattern reverses. Under feedback inconsis- tency, where performance on a primary goal is low but performance on a secondary goal is high, decision-makers decrease distal search along both the technological and the organi- zational dimensions. Distal search increases only when performance is consistent and below aspirations on both goals. Our arguments and results make two signi ﬁ cant contributions to research on performance feedback. Speci ﬁ cally, we develop and test novel theory on how performance feedback on multiple goals that follow a hierarchy of importance in ﬂ uences how organizations regulate the locus of search, particularly distal search. We show that poor performance on a primary goal may signal a serious problem that  “ rules out the space of solutions local to cur- rently employed activities ”  (Posen et al., 2018: 237) and directly triggers distal solution search, but only if performance feedback on a secondary goal also exhibits performance below aspirations. By contrast, performance below aspirations on a primary goal and perfor- mance above aspirations on a secondary goal prompt decision-makers to redirect search to less distal technological and organizational dimensions. Our arguments and  ﬁ ndings are important because prior research on multiple goals has exclusively considered search inten- sity, ignoring that search may occur in different locations. Our research also makes a novel contribution to studies of self-enhancement and learning from performance feedback. Prior work has argued that self-enhancement motivates decision- makers to reduce search in response to performance feedback (Blagoeva, Mom, Jansen, & George, 2020; Jordan & Audia, 2012). To our knowledge, this is the  ﬁ rst study to propose that the self-enhancement motive may also account for variations in the locus of search. Indeed, our theory and  ﬁ ndings suggest that, in situations of feedback inconsistency regarding multiple goals, self-enhancing decision-makers may experience greater latitude to choose whether to respond by directing search inside the organization or to more familiar technolo- gies instead of only reducing the intensity of search altogether as previous research would predict. Self-enhancement, therefore, may not only lead to a (re)prioritization of goals, by focusing attention on a secondary goal that shows high performance, but also to a (re)prior- itization of the locus of search choices that decision-makers are willing to pursue to protect their self-image. In this way, this study opens a new line of research that examines the in ﬂ u- ence of self-enhancement on learning from performance feedback by suggesting that the desire to maintain and boost a positive self-image may also be ful ﬁ lled by selecting speci ﬁ c loci of responsive actions."
Theory and Hypotheses," Most research on the relationship between performance and organizational responses has assumed that organizations focus only on a single goal at any time. The goal that has 4 Journal of Management dominated researchers ’  attention is ROA (Greve, 2003b). But while ROA is often the highest-level goal to which senior executives allocate their attention, more recent work has started to recognize a wide range of other goals that may coexist with pro ﬁ tability, such as productivity (Mazzelli et al., 2019), size (Greve, 2008), status (Baum et al., 2005), or safety (Gaba & Greve, 2019). Such multiple goals are typically arranged in a hierarchy of importance where some goals are more important than others. The prevailing assumption is that in the context of for-pro ﬁ t organizations, pro ﬁ tability metrics and their close correlates, such as market share and sales growth, are at the top of the hierarchy of goal importance because of their commonly agreed-upon nature (Shinkle, 2012). As Rowley, Shipilov and Greve (2017: 819) note,  “ If the  ﬁ rm does not generate satisfactory  ﬁ nancial results, it will simply be not viable for very long. ”  Indeed, some studies that have examined multiple goals support this view, suggesting, for example, that goals that have a more distant impact on prof- itability — such as growth (Greve, 2008) and corporate governance ratings (Rowley, Shipilov, & Greve, 2017) — occupy a lower position in the hierarchy of goal importance. Once the existence of multiple goals of varying importance is acknowledged, the question arises of how performance on these goals affects organizational responses. The traditional view in the literature follows Cyert and March ’ s (1963) sequential attention approach to suggest that organizations attend  ﬁ rst to performance signals on primary goals, as these are perceived as more salient, and, once these goals are ful ﬁ lled, performance feedback on sec- ondary goals is activated (Greve, 2008). Yet, recent studies have started to highlight that, in many situations, decision-makers may need to process multiple goals simultaneously rather than sequentially (Audia & Greve, 2021; Gaba & Greve, 2019; Hu & Bettis, 2018). In these instances, they are confronted with both consistent and inconsistent performance feed- back (Audia & Brion, 2007), on which they rely to determine whether current courses of action regarding primary and secondary goals denote success or failure. Incorporating multiple goals raises the question of how organizations respond to inconsis- tent performance signals. Research that emphasizes a self-enhancement approach suggests that decision-makers may consider multiple goals simultaneously and may  ﬁ rst and foremost be motivated to maintain a positive image and focus on information that emphasizes high per- formance (Audia & Brion, 2007; Jordan & Audia, 2012). Because they care about maintaining a positive image (Audia & Brion, 2007), decision-makers primarily responsible for the out- comes measured using multiple goals will capitalize on the ambiguity generated by inconsis- tent performance feedback to assign greater weight to the goals that display positive outcomes. Such a favorable assessment of performance, whereby low performance on a primary goal is de-emphasized so that greater consideration is given to high performance on a secondary goal, has been found to reduce the propensity to make changes (Audia & Brion, 2007; Kostopoulos et al., 2023), and is hypothesized to reduce the intensity of search (Jordan & Audia, 2012). While prior research on multiple goals has added much to our understanding of how con- sistent and inconsistent feedback regulates the intensity of search, it has remained silent regarding a second, equally important dimension of search, namely the locus of search (Greve, 2018). Where organizations search for solutions is important because it precedes the selection of a speci ﬁ c behavioral response, and thus the different types of responses and disparate outcomes to performance shortfalls reported in prior research could be explained by the hitherto unexplored locus of search choices deriving from performance feed- back to multiple goals (Greve, 2018; Posen et al., 2018). Keil et al. / (In)Consistent Performance Feedback and the Locus of Search 5"
Prior Research on the Locus of Search," Research on the locus of search has been scarce (Greve, 2018; Posen et al., 2018) and limited to situations of performance relative to a single goal (Greve, 2018). We, therefore, start our theory building from a review of studies that carry potential implications for how performance feedback on single goals affects the locus of search. Two broad streams exist. One stream of studies, indirectly related to the locus of search, focuses on the type of changes low-performing organizations are more likely to make. To illustrate, Kuusela, Keil, and Maula (2017) show that the likelihood of acquisitions decreases with the magnitude of performance shortfalls, whereas the likelihood of divestments increases. Eggers and Suh (2019) show that the launch of new products in domains with prior experience, or the launch in new domains, depends upon whether performance feedback stems from novel prod- ucts or products with prior experience. However, the locus of change and the locus of search do not necessarily align since search is an antecedent of change, and not all search results in change. Hence, an organization may search in multiple domains but may choose to change based on the results of only some of these search efforts. While still con ﬂ ating search and change, a second stream seems to get closer to the locus of search choices. Noteworthy in this stream is a study by Baum and colleagues (2005) that focuses on where investment banks search for bank partners in underwriting deals. Applying insights from performance feedback theory, they  ﬁ nd that decision-makers in an organization performing slightly below aspirations are more inclined to search for bank part- ners within their existing network rather than outside their network, presumably because they need only small and safer performance improvements anchored in current solutions. In con- trast, they  ﬁ nd that decision-makers in an organization performing far below its aspiration level are more likely to search for partners beyond their network because they likely need riskier solutions that may provide a greater chance of raising the organization ’ s performance to the aspiration level. Similarly, Iyer, Baù, Chirico, Patel, and Brush (2019) suggest that the larger a performance shortfall, the more likely an organization is to make unrelated rather than related acquisitions. Kavusan and Frankort (2019) found that, with increasing performance shortfalls,  ﬁ rms form new alliances with novel partners yet focus on existing resources. Although this line of work points to the likelihood of a more far-reaching in ﬂ uence of low performance on where search activities occur (e.g., outside an organization ’ s network or to unrelated industries), it still does not examine search in isolation from the decisions that cap- italize on search. For example, acquisition decisions build on search that generates candidate ﬁ rms which a focal organization considers acquiring, but not all are acquired. It is incorrect, therefore, to infer from the decisions ultimately made the locus of search preceding them. Prior work, mentioned above, also falls short of providing a coherent theoretical argument of the locus of search, and how performance feedback — including performance on multiple goals — regulates it."
Performance on a Primary Goal and the Locus of Search," To derive predictions regarding the implications of performance feedback for the locus of search, it is useful to distinguish between local and distal search (Cyert & March, 1963). Cyert and March (1963) suggested that search may be local along multiple 6 Journal of Management dimensions, speci ﬁ cally close to current activities and within the unit where these activ- ities take place. Research on technological search that has developed largely indepen- dently of the performance feedback theory (Posen et al., 2018) has introduced a similar distinction by differentiating between search that occurs along two dimensions: techno- logical and organizational (Rosenkopf & Nerkar, 2001; Rothaermel & Alexandre, 2009). For responses to performance feedback, this implies that low-performing organi- zations face the choice to search locally or distally along the technological dimension, directing search to areas that build upon familiar or unfamiliar knowledge, and the choice to search locally or distally along the organizational dimension, directing solution search within or outside the organization. Central to either choice are important differences in the implementation and outcomes of local and distal search (Laursen, 2012; Rosenkopf & Nerkar, 2001). Local search, for instance, is often considered easier to implement, less costly, and less risky (Rosenkopf & Almeida, 2003). For local search along the technological dimension, the key argument is that knowledge and resources are familiar, and thus the organization needs less cognitive effort to assess and coordinate solutions across (local vs. distant) knowledge areas (Knudsen & Levinthal, 2007). This, in turn, may generate better (shortterm) performance (Taylor & Greve, 2006). For local search along the organizational dimension, the key argu- ment goes beyond familiarity and relates to the increased control over the search process and the innovations it generates (Pisano, 1990). However, local search along either dimension may not create suf ﬁ cient novelty to  ﬁ x serious problems, constraining the development of truly innovative products (Reed & DeFilippi, 1990) and potentially leading the organization into competency traps (Levitt & March, 1988). In other words, local search — either along the organizational or the technological dimension — is often viewed as less risky but also more limited in the rewards it can provide. In contrast, distal search allows the focal  ﬁ rm to absorb and integrate knowledge from unfamiliar technological areas or from other organizations (Rosenkopf & Nerkar, 2001), and may therefore lead to more novel solutions and more innovative products that increase sales (Eklund & Kapoor, 2022; Laursen & Salter, 2006; Monteiro & Birkinshaw, 2017). However, organizations engaging in distal search along the organizational dimension may also need to accept the limited control and potentially higher costs it involves, and may need to develop the capacity to effectively absorb external knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). Similarly, organizations engaging in distal search along the technological dimension may often need to absorb new knowledge and accept the higher risk of failure and inherent uncertainty related to unfamiliar knowledge areas. In other words, distal search across either dimension may potentially have higher rewards, but these come with an associated increase in risk. Previous studies suggest that organizations generally prefer local search (Laursen, 2012; Laursen & Salter, 2006; Rosenkopf & Nerkar, 2001). However, following performance feed- back theory, we expect that the more performance falls below aspirations on a primary goal, the higher the organization ’ s propensity to perform distal search across both the technological and the organizational dimension. Speci ﬁ cally, the arguments of Baum and colleagues (2005) and Eggers and Suh (2019) imply that, with growing underperformance, organizations will increasingly be willing to take the higher risks associated with distal search. According to Cyert and March (1963) and Greve (2003a, 2003b), these effects are especially likely Keil et al. / (In)Consistent Performance Feedback and the Locus of Search 7 when increasing performance shortfalls relate to goals of high importance in an organization ’ s goal hierarchy. When organizations underperform on a primary goal, they are more likely to expand their search efforts outside their technological or organizational boundaries to acquire resources and  ﬁ nd novel solutions they lack, thus being more willing to tolerate high risks to ﬁ x serious problems. Therefore, performance below aspirations on a primary goal leads to an increased propensity to engage in distal search across both the technological and the organi- zational dimensions. We hypothesize: Hypothesis 1:  Performance feedback below aspirations on a primary goal will lead to more distal search along (a) the technological dimension (i.e., unfamiliar technological areas) and (b) the organizational dimension (i.e., external to the organization)."
"Performance on Multiple Goals, Self-Enhancement, and the Locus of Search"," While Hypothesis 1, consistent with most prior research, considers only the primary goal in setting the locus of search, next, we incorporate performance feedback regarding multiple goals. Our primary thesis is that the self-enhancement motive also plays a central role in reg- ulating the locus of search choices. Speci ﬁ cally, we suggest that when faced with inconsistent feedback, with low perfor- mance on a primary goal and high performance on a secondary goal, decision-makers will direct the locus of search from distal to local search. Local search is aligned with a positive self-image because it draws upon knowledge familiar to the organization and generated inside the organization, whereas distal search is aligned with a negative self-image as familiar knowledge and knowledge generated within the organization does not suf ﬁ ce to address the performance issues faced by the organization. Since situations of feedback inconsistency create ambiguity and room for interpretation (Audia & Brion, 2007), self-enhancing decision- makers may not only favorably assess performance but also choose search directions that protect their self-image while still offering plausible solutions. Building on the ambiguity generated by inconsistent performance signals, decision-makers are able to reprioritize where they search by selecting solution spaces that enhance their image of competence. Directing search within organizational boundaries or in familiar technological areas suggests that the organization and its decision-makers have the necessary knowledge and skills to develop novel solutions. In contrast, searching outside the technological and organizational landscapes suggests that a  ﬁ rm ’ s competence is insuf ﬁ cient to produce good-enough solu- tions. Furthermore, local search reinforces the credibility of previous choices. It serves as a signal of trust to an organization ’ s personnel. By contrast, distal search can be interpreted as an indication that a  ﬁ rm ’ s efforts and capabilities are not valued, which, in turn, may hurt decision-makers ’  self-image and give a negative signal to the market that can jeopardize the competitive position of the organization (Cole & Chandler, 2019; Levinthal & Rerup, 2021). Searching outside the organization, therefore, often faces internal resistance (Antons & Piller, 2015; Laursen & Salter, 2006) and can be perceived as a threat that self-enhancing decision-makers prefer to avoid. Taken together, under conditions of ambiguity that stem from inconsistent feedback, self- enhancing decision-makers will be inclined to reduce distal search and pursue more local search that signals that the organization has what it takes to  ﬁ x performance problems. Hence, we hypothesize: 8 Journal of Management Hypothesis 2:  Inconsistent performance feedback with performance on a primary goal below aspi- rations and performance on a secondary goal above aspirations will lead to less distal search along (a) the technological dimension (i.e., unfamiliar technological areas) and (b) the organiza- tional dimension (i.e., external to the organization). It is important to note that these hypothesized effects of inconsistent feedback from mul- tiple goals in guiding the locus of search are independent of the effects of this feedback in reducing the intensity of problemistic search. While self-enhancement theory suggests that with inconsistent feedback (additional) problemistic search is suppressed and, therefore, the overall intensity of search remains unchanged or is even reduced, we propose that the organization may redirect its (remaining) search behavior towards less distal (more local) landscapes."
Methods,
Sample and Data," We test our hypotheses in the context of the global pharmaceutical industry. This industry constitutes an appropriate empirical setting to examine our arguments because a hierarchy of (R&D) goals is well documented, performance is regularly monitored at different points of the R&D process, and the search for solutions outside the  ﬁ rm ’ s technological and organiza- tional boundaries plays an important role (Higgins & Rodriguez, 2006; Hoang & Rothaermel, 2010; Macher & Boerner, 2012; Nishimura & Okada, 2014; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 1999). Speci ﬁ cally, the pharmaceutical clinical trials process is an excellent context because it allows us to assess different goals within a hierarchy of clinical trials ’  goals and alternative responses to examine the locus of search. In the pharmaceutical industry, the goal of innova- tion performance at the R&D portfolio level can be subdivided into multiple (sub)goals, such as goals related to the number of drug candidates passing the early stages (i.e., Preclinical and Phase I) and the number of drug candidates passing the late stages (i.e., Phases II and III) of the clinical trials process each year. By paying attention to performance feedback regarding such goals, pharmaceutical companies can modify their R&D portfolio choices. The goals in clinical trials form a clear hierarchy of importance, where the goals of late- stage clinical trials are more important given that performance below aspirations at late stages has a direct impact on innovation performance and  ﬁ nancial performance as it means that the  ﬁ rm will have fewer new drugs that it can launch in the market. Further, late- stage trials incur substantially higher costs (Kola & Landis, 2004), and attrition at this stage may create substantial market pressure on pharmaceutical  ﬁ rms (Frantz, 2006). In contrast, early-stage clinical trials ’  goals are less important because they have a less direct impact on innovation performance and  ﬁ nancial performance. Succeeding in early clinical trials does not impact the near-term potential launch of drugs in the market and, conversely, not meeting early-stage goals is not a fatal failure since  ﬁ rms have plenty of time to make adjust- ments (Mathieu, 2002; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 1999). Research on the R&D process of pharmaceutical  ﬁ rms parallels the hierarchical distinction between early- and late-stage clinical trials and, more speci ﬁ cally, recommends grouping Keil et al. / (In)Consistent Performance Feedback and the Locus of Search 9 Preclinical and Phase I as early-stage trials because they focus on the safety dimension of drug development, and Phase II and Phase III as late-stage trials because they focus on the ef ﬁ cacy dimension of drug development (Higgins & Rodriguez, 2006; Lee, Lee, Wu, Lee, & Chen, 2005; Nishimura & Okada, 2014). Our sample consists of 98 global incumbent pharmaceutical  ﬁ rms with a portfolio of clin- ical trials regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 1993 until the end of 2021 1,2   (2370  ﬁ rm-year observations in total), representing more than 80% of sales in the industry, worldwide (as compiled by IMS sales data). We chose to sample global incumbent ﬁ rms (i.e.,  ﬁ rms that were active in the pharmaceutical industry prior to the emergence of bio- technology; for a similar approach please see Grigoriou & Rothaermel, 2017; Hess & Rothaermel, 2011; Rothaermel & Thursby, 2007) because only these companies have the resources to support a portfolio of multiple, high-cost clinical trials over an extended period of time. This allowed us to collect reliable clinical trial data and test our theory across the study period. Further, to account for major mergers and acquisitions that occurred between incumbents in our sample (there were eight such events in total), we followed the prior research and treated these companies as combined entities throughout the entire study period (Nerkar & Roberts, 2004). An additional analysis in which these companies were treated as separate entities until the year of the merger or acquisition produced similar results. To measure our main dependent and independent variables, we collected clinical trial data from Inteleos, Citeline ’ s Pharmaprojects, and Trialtrove databases. These databases provide extensive information regarding the clinical trials pipeline of the global pharmaceutical indus- try and are widely utilized to study R&D processes in the management literature (Hess & Rothaermel, 2011; Sosa, 2013). In addition, we collected  ﬁ nancial data from Compustat ’ s Annual Updates Fundamentals database, which includes global companies ’  annual historical ﬁ nancial data from 1987 onward."
Dependent Variable," We operationalize distal search along two search dimensions: the technological (i.e., unfa- miliar search) and the organizational dimension (i.e., external search). Unfamiliar and external (vs. familiar and internal) search activities represent distal (vs. local) search that re ﬂ ects critical decisions in R&D portfolio management, capturing the direction and related adjustments of the ﬁ rm ’ s R&D behavior (e.g., He & Wong, 2004; Lavie, Stettner, & Tushman, 2010; Nishimura & Okada, 2014; Uotila, Maula, Keil, & Zahra, 2009). Our measure of unfamiliar search is the number of drug candidates that enter clinical trials in a focal year in a disease area in which the company did not have clinical trials the previous 5 years. To create this measure, we relied on the list of the 14 main disease areas provided by Citeline ’ s Pharmaprojects (please see the Appendix in the online supplemental material). Our measure of external search is the number of drug candidates entering clinical trials in a focal year that were acquired through licensing or acquisitions. To identify whether drug candidates were externally sourced by our sampled ﬁ rms, we used related information provided by Inteleos and Citeline ’ s Pharmaprojects databases. In a series of posthoc tests, we also use as our dependent variable ratios obtained by dividing the abovementioned variables by the total number of drug candidates in clinical trials initiated during the focal year. We report these models in the additional analyses section following the results of our main analyses. 10 Journal of Management"
Independent Variables," We compute two performance measures following four steps. First, we calculated perfor- mance on a primary goal as the number of drug candidates passing the late stages (i.e., Phases II and III) of the clinical trials process, and performance on a secondary goal as the number of drug candidates passing the early stages (i.e., Preclinical and Phase I). These provide concrete evidence regarding the ef ﬁ cacy (primary goal) and safety (secondary goal) of the drug can- didate portfolio and are regularly monitored by pharmaceutical  ﬁ rms during their drug devel- opment process (Mathieu, 2002; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 1999). Second, we created a measure for the performance aspiration level (Bromiley & Harris, 2014; Greve, 1998). Following Cyert and March (1963) and more recent work (Blettner, He, Hu, & Bettis, 2015; Greve, 2003a; O ’ Brien & David, 2014), we use a combination of the  ﬁ rm ’ s social and historical early- and late-stage aspirations to calculate performance aspi- ration level 3,4   based on the assumption that pharmaceutical companies concurrently evaluate (a) whether they are performing better or worse than their competitors at gaining the approval of regulatory bodies (Schulze & Ringel, 2013; i.e., social aspirations), and (b) whether their performance constitutes an improvement or a deterioration in relation to their own past out- comes (Hess & Rothaermel, 2011; i.e., historical aspirations). Social (SA), historical (HA), and overall (AL) aspirations levels were calculated using the following formulas, where  t is the time;  i  refers to the focal  ﬁ rm;  p  refers to the early (Preclinical and Phase I) or late (Phase II and Phase III) stages of clinical trials;  N  is the total number of  ﬁ rms (including  i ) conducting clinical trials in the same disease area as focal  ﬁ rm  i ;  j  refers to each of the  N  com- peting  ﬁ rms, excluding focal  ﬁ rm  i  (i.e.,  j  ≠  i ); and a 1  and a 2  are the corresponding weights for historical and social aspirations, respectively. SA ipt  = � j ≠ i   Successful exits from clinical trials phases  jt N  −  1 HA ipt  =  a 1 HA ip ( t − 1)  +  (1  −  a 1 ) Performance ip ( t − 1) AL ipt  =  a 2 SA ipt  +  (1  −  a 2 ) HA ipt Following Greve ’ s (2003a) approach, we empirically determined the values for a 1  and a 2  that best  ﬁ t the data. This procedure yielded a value of 0.8 for a 1  and a value of 0.9 for a 2 . These values suggest that, in this particular context, (a) pharmaceutical  ﬁ rms due to the long process of new drug development assess their performance based on a longer period historical aspi- ration level (Muttenthaler, King, Adams, & Alewood, 2021) and (b) overall aspirations are mostly driven by social aspirations. This is consistent with the view that in the pharmaceutical sector companies are always racing against their competitors to launch new drugs on the market and, therefore, can be expected to closely monitor their innovation output (Schulze & Ringel, 2013). Third, we take the absolute value of the  ﬁ rm ’ s actual performance in the early and late stages of clinical trials minus the aspiration level to capture the distance of  ﬁ rm performance from the aspiration level. Fourth, following the approach introduced by Greve (1998) to examine theoretically derived discontinuities in the in ﬂ uence of performance across the performance range, we Keil et al. / (In)Consistent Performance Feedback and the Locus of Search 11 utilize a spline speci ﬁ cation. Greve included two categories that together cover the entire range of performance: performance above the aspiration level, and performance below the aspiration level. Examination of the sign and signi ﬁ cance of the coef ﬁ cients of these two var- iables reveals linearity or discontinuity in the in ﬂ uence of performance on the outcome of interest. The knot or point at which the variable is split is where performance equals the aspi- ration level, a point that is theoretically derived. We use this approach, which is now widely used in research on the relationship between past performance and change (e.g., Audia & Greve, 2006; Gaba & Greve, 2019), to test Hypothesis 1. We then expand this approach to test Hypothesis 2 by creating four spline variables that together cover the four combinations of performance on two goals. Again, differences in the sign and signi ﬁ cance of the coef ﬁ - cients are indicative of non linearity. The two categories concerning performance on a primary goal below the aspiration allow us to test Hypothesis 2. The other two allow us to cover the entire range of performance in ﬂ uences — that is, when performance on a primary goal is above the aspiration. Speci ﬁ cally, to test Hypothesis 1, we include in the models two distinct variables: one cap- tures situations in which performance on the primary goal is below the aspiration level and is zero when performance is above the aspiration level; and the second captures situations in which performance on the primary goal is above the aspiration level and is zero when perfor- mance is below the aspiration level. A positive coef ﬁ cient of performance below the aspira- tion level would support Hypothesis 1. We do not formulate a prediction regarding the in ﬂ uence of performance above the aspiration level. To test Hypothesis 2, we create two measures of performance on multiple goals: consistent negative feedback and inconsistent feedback with the primary goal below the aspiration level. Consistent negative feedback captures situations in which both performance on the primary goal and performance on the secondary goal are below the aspiration level. This measure is equal to the absolute value of the difference between performance and overall aspiration level for early-stage clinical trials (secondary goal) when performance is below the aspiration level multiplied by the absolute value of the difference between performance and aspiration level for late-stage clinical trials (primary goal) when performance is below aspirations. This var- iable takes the value of zero for other combinations of feedback on the primary and secondary goal (i.e., when the performance in at least one of these two goals exceeds aspirations). Inconsistent feedback captures situations in which performance on the primary goal is below the aspiration level and performance on the secondary goal is above the aspiration level. When this inconsistency occurs, this variable equals the absolute value of the difference between performance and overall aspiration level for late-stage clinical trials multiplied by the value of the difference between performance and overall aspiration level for early-stage clinical trials. This variable equals zero in other combinations of feedback on late- and early-stage clinical trials. A negative and signi ﬁ cant coef ﬁ cient for inconsistent feedback would lend support to Hypothesis 2. To cover the entire range of performance situations when both goals are considered, we also include in the analyses a measure of consistent positive feedback when performance is above the aspiration level for both goals and a measure of inconsistent feedback in which per- formance on the primary goal is above the aspiration level and performance on the secondary goal is below the aspiration level. We do not formulate predictions about the in ﬂ uence of these two performance situations, although we report their implication for the overall pattern of  ﬁ ndings. 12 Journal of Management"
Control Variables," We control for the number of patented molecules (i.e., patents that include at least one Derwent compound number) that the focal company registered in the last 10 years in any patent of ﬁ ce included in the Derwent database. The availability of a larger number of patented molecules may in ﬂ uence whether  ﬁ rms choose to search distally or locally when initiating clinical trial projects. Because this variable is positively skewed and has many zero values, we use the natural logarithm of the number of patented molecules. We also control for the total number of licensing-in opportunities by including a variable that captures the number of R&D alliances and acquisitions that the company formed during the focal and the last 4 years. We used Re ﬁ nitiv ’ s SDC database to identify the R&D alliances and acquisitions formed by our sampled pharmaceutical  ﬁ rms. We control for  ﬁ rm size, which we measure as the natural logarithm of the number of employees in a  ﬁ rm. We also control for  ﬁ rm-level  ﬁ nancial performance aspirations, which we measure using return on total assets (ROA) and operationalize in a similar manner as our main independent variables (e.g., Greve, 2003a). To control for market-level factors, we include the competitive intensity in the R&D market measured as the natural log- arithm of the number of competing clinical trial projects in each disease area in a given year. Finally, to control for time and origin effects, we include year and country (the United States, the European Union, and the rest of the world) dummies, respectively. The theory of performance feedback views performance on goals as providing infor- mation that in ﬂ uences the choices that organizations make, but performance also leads to an accumulation or a depletion of resources. To account for the possibility that the anal- ysis of the in ﬂ uence of performance re ﬂ ects potential  “ resource ”  effects, we control for several indicators of resources. We reason that any  “ resource ”  effect will be re ﬂ ected in the coef ﬁ cients of these variables. First, we control for R&D capability operationalized as a  ﬁ rm ’ s annual investment in R&D divided by its sales for that year. Second, we control for three different types of slack resources: (a) unabsorbed slack — the ratio of cash and marketable securities to liabilities; (b) absorbed slack — the ratio of selling, general, and administrative expenses to sales; and (c) potential slack — the ratio of debt to equity (e.g., Greve, 2003a). In addition, because a  ﬁ rm ’ s age is often seen as a proxy for the availability of resources to innovate (Kotha, Zheng, & George, 2011), we control for ﬁ rm age as the number of years since incorporation. Finally, while our main interest lies in examining situations in which performance on a primary goal is below the aspiration level, as we mention in our description of the computa- tion of the independent variables, we also include measures that capture situations in which performance on the primary goal is above the aspiration level."
Results," Our data is structured as a panel dataset with the  ﬁ rm-year period as the unit of analysis and multiple observations for each  ﬁ rm. Because the dependent variables are counts that show overdispersion (chisquare for alpha equal zero  =  515.26 for unfamiliar search; chisquare for alpha equal zero  =  29.95 for external search), we employ a negative binomial regression estimator. Following Allison and Waterman (2002), we estimate  ﬁ xed effects by including a Keil et al. / (In)Consistent Performance Feedback and the Locus of Search 13 dummy variable for each  ﬁ rm. In the Additional Analyses section, we report results obtained using OLS regression with  ﬁ xed effects in which the dependent variables are ratio measures of the dependent variables. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics, whereas Table 2 presents the pairwise correlations of our variables. Table 3 reports results for unfamiliar search — the number of drug candidates that enter clinical trials in a focal year in a disease area in which the company did not have clinical trials in the previous 5 years — whereas Table 4 reports results for external search — the number of drug candidates entering clinical trials in a focal year that were acquired through licensing or acquisitions. In Table 1, apart from the expected high correlations among some of the performance variables (e.g., consistent negative feedback and perfor- mance feedback with primary goal below), all bivariate correlations are below the commonly used threshold of 0.60, thereby mitigating concerns about multicollinearity. Variance in ﬂ a- tion factors (VIFs) for the coef ﬁ cients are also well below the most commonly used cut-off values as the maximum VIF is 2.12 (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2013), providing further evidence that multicollinearity is not a problem in our analyses. Focusing  ﬁ rst on the control variables, Model 1 in Table 3 indicates that  ﬁ rms that are older, ﬁ rms with greater unabsorbed slack and, to a lesser, extent  ﬁ rms with more employees, are all less likely to engage in unfamiliar search. Model 4 in Table 4 points to a different but sensible pattern for the control variables where  ﬁ rms with a larger number of alliances in the last 5 years engage in more external search and  ﬁ rms with U.S. headquarters engage in less external search.

ROA  =  return on assets; R&D  =  research and development. 15 Turning to our  ﬁ rst hypothesis, we  ﬁ rst observe in Model 2 in Table 3 a positive and sig- ni ﬁ cant coef ﬁ cient ( β  =  0.31;  p  =  .000). This indicates that the more performance falls below aspirations on a primary goal, the higher the organization ’ s propensity to engage in unfamiliar search. Using the margin command in Stata, we  ﬁ nd that when performance on the primary goal drops by a standard deviation, the unfamiliar search increases by approximately 0.8 more unfamiliar projects. Similarly, in Model 5 in Table 4 we  ﬁ nd that the coef ﬁ cient for perfor- mance feedback below aspirations on a primary goal is positive and signi ﬁ cant ( β  =  0.22;  p =  .015), indicating that the more performance on a primary goal falls below aspirations, the higher is the organization ’ s propensity to engage in external search. In this case, when performance on the primary goal drops by a standard deviation, the external search increases by approximately 0.3. Taken together, these results provide support for Hypothesis 1.

These results are consistent with a tendency for high-performing  ﬁ rms to reduce the propensity to engage in distal search on both the technological and the organi- zational dimension.

Model 3 in Table 3 shows that the coef ﬁ cient for the inconsistent feedback variable is negative and sig- ni ﬁ cant ( β  =  − 0.38;  p  =  .000) whereas the coef ﬁ cient for the consistent negative feedback var- iable is positive and signi ﬁ cant ( β  =  0.08;  p  =  .000). Speci ﬁ cally, when performance on a primary goal drops by a standard deviation and performance on a secondary goal is high — that is, one standard deviation above the mean value of performance feedback from the sec- ondary goal above — unfamiliar search decreases by approximately 0.6 unfamiliar projects. Conversely, when performance on a primary goal drops by a standard deviation and perfor- mance on a secondary goal is low — that is, one standard deviation below the mean — unfamil- iar search increases by approximately 0.8 unfamiliar projects. Moving to Model 6 in Table 4, we  ﬁ nd a negative and signi ﬁ cant coef ﬁ cient for the inconsistent feedback variable ( β  = − 0.37;  p  =  .049; Model 3, Table 4). Here, however, the coef ﬁ cient for the consistent negative feedback is positive but not signi ﬁ cant ( β  =  0.02;  p  =  .452). The negative and signi ﬁ cant coef- ﬁ cient for the inconsistent feedback variable implies that when performance on a primary goal drops by a standard deviation and performance on a secondary goal is high — that is, one stan- dard deviation above the mean value of performance feedback from secondary goal above — external search decreases by approximately 1.2 external projects. Overall, the results in Model 3 in Tables 3 and Model 6 in Table 4 provide strong support for Hypothesis 2 which holds that in cases of inconsistent feedback, where performance on a primary goal is below aspirations but, at the same time, performance on a secondary goal is above aspirations, decision-makers ’ propensity to engage in distal (unfamiliar or external) search decreases. While the main focus here is on situations in which performance on a primary goal falls below the aspiration, to provide a complete account of the in ﬂ uence of performance on the propensity to engage in distal search, we considered also the in ﬂ uence of situations in which performance on the primary goal is above the aspiration. Model 3 in Table 3 shows negative but nonsigni ﬁ cant coef ﬁ cients for the inconsistent feedback variable (performance on primary goal above aspiration but performance on secondary goal below aspiration) and for the consis- tent positive feedback variable (performance on primary goal above aspiration and performance on secondary goal above aspiration). These coef ﬁ cients mirror the negative but not signi ﬁ cant coef ﬁ cient in Model 2, Table 3. Model 6 in Table 4 shows negative cof ﬁ cients for both variables signi ﬁ cant at least at the .10 level. These results therefore con ﬁ rm, as a general yet weak trend, a propensity by  ﬁ rms in our sample to reduce distal search when performance on the primary goal is above the aspiration level, regardless of whether performance on a secondary goal is above or below the aspiration level. Our theoretical analysis is consistent with this pattern because we have suggested that the tendency to shy away from distal search is strengthened by the percep- tion of threat that is felt when performance on a primary goal falls below the aspiration level. Lastly, we run models replacing the spline variables with the interaction between performance on primary goal below aspirations and performance on secondary goal above aspirations. While the negative binomial regression does not converge, we are able to report the results obtained using OLS regression, in which which we use the ratio variables. While the interaction does not allow to estimate separate coef ﬁ cients for situations of consistent and inconsistent feedback, the result is in line with our prediction as the interaction term shows a negative and signi ﬁ cant coef ﬁ cient on both unfamiliar search and external search ( β  =  − 0.03;  p  =  .000 for unfamiliar search, and  β  =  − 0.21;  p  =  .000 for external search). 18 Journal of Management"
Additional Analyses," Model with the intensity of search.  It is helpful to consider the in ﬂ uence of performance on the total number of drug candidates entering clinical trials (i.e., total count of search), irre- spective of whether they are in unfamiliar disease areas or external to the organization. This dependent variable approximates the intensity of search rather than its locus. We report the results in Table 5. We observe that search intensity goes up when performance on the primary goal is below the aspiration level ( β  =  0.27;  p  =  .000; Model 8, Table 5). We also observe that this effect remains for consistent negative feedback ( β  =  0.08;  p  =  .000; Model 8, Table 5) but disappears for inconsistent feedback ( β  =  0.04;  p  =  .205; Model 8, Table 5). An explanation of this pattern is that self-enhancing assessments of performance turn off the impetus for more search (Jordan & Audia, 2012). Considered in conjunction with the results of our main analyses, the pattern emerging in our sample is that when performance on a primary goal is below the aspiration level and performance on a secondary goal is above the aspiration level, not only does the intensity of search not increase — as predicted by research that focuses on single goals — but distal search decreases. Ratio measures of the dependent variables.  To test the robustness of the results concern- ing unfamiliar and external search, we ran OLS regression with  ﬁ rm  ﬁ xed effects and ratio variables as dependent variables (Tables 6 and 7). Unfamiliar search ratio is the number of drug candidates that enter clinical trials in a focal year in a disease area in which the company did not have clinical trials in the previous 5 years divided by the total number of drug candidates in clinical trials initiated during the focal year. External search ratio is the number of drug candidates entering clinical trials in a focal year that were acquired through licensing or acquisitions divided by the total number of drug candidates in clinical trials initiated during the focal year. The pattern of the results emerging from these additional analyses is reassuring. For example, in Tables 6 and 7, Hypothesis 1 (both parts) was con- ﬁ rmed as performance on a primary goal below aspiration has a positive and statistically sig- ni ﬁ cant coef ﬁ cient for both ratio variables ( β  =  0.02;  p  =  .000 in Model 11, Table 6;  β  =  0.03; p  =  .000 in Model 14, Table 7). Hypothesis 2 was also supported as the inconsistent perfor- mance feedback with performance on a primary goal below aspirations and performance on a secondary goal above aspirations has a negative and signi ﬁ cant coef ﬁ cient on the percentage change towards both unfamiliar and external search ( β  =  − 0.01;  p  =  .000 in Model 12, Table 6;  β  =  − 0.01;  p  =  .000 in Model 15, Table 7). Preliminary analyses showed the same pattern when we used Poisson regressions with the count dependent variables. Additional robustness and endogeneity tests.  First, we tested the sensitivity of our  ﬁ ndings to outliers (in ﬂ uential observations) by winsorizing at the 99th percentile variables that have a maximum value higher than the mean plus three standard deviations (as presented in Table 2). The results with these winsorized variables are largely similar to our original  ﬁ ndings (for unfamiliar search, Hypothesis 1:  β  =  0.34,  p  =  .000, and Hypothesis 2:  β  =  − 0.41,  p  =  .012; for external search, Hypothesis 1:  β  =  0.30,  p  =  .032, and Hypothesis 2:  β  =  − 0.42,  p  = .044), thus indicating that outliers do not substantially affect our results. Furthermore, we considered potential endogeneity concerns regarding our two indepen- dent variables. Since projects need to pass the early stages of clinical trials to enter the late Keil et al. / (In)Consistent Performance Feedback and the Locus of Search 19 stages, it is conceivable that performance of projects at late-stage trials may be endogenous to the performance of projects at the early stages at a prior point in time. We believe that the likelihood of this is relatively small because the success factor in each stage is different. Speci ﬁ cally, in the early stages, the success factor is the level of toxicity of the drug, whereas in the late stages, the success factor is the ef ﬁ cacy of the drug compared to other drugs in the market or the full recovery after treatment rate. There is no evidence, for example, that a drug that has successfully  ﬁ nished Phase I as non-toxic will necessarily also be effective in treating a disease. Also, ef ﬁ cacy does not imply safety, as several cases show that promising drug candidates with good ef ﬁ cacy results in late-stage trials eventually Table 5 Negative Binomial Regression Analysis of Total Search With Year and Company Dummies Total Search M7 M8 M9 β SE P β SE P β SE P Performance feedback with primary goal below 0.27 0.02 .000 Inconsistent feedback with primary goal below 0.04 0.03 .205 Consistent negative feedback 0.08 0.01 .000 Number of employees (log) − 0.37 0.20 .067 − 0.14 0.19 .460 − 0.33 0.18 .076 Performance feedback ROA below − 0.68 1.47 .645 − 1.48 1.36 .276 − 1.60 1.37 .244 Performance feedback ROA above − 0.75 1.40 .589 − 1.31 1.32 .321 − 1.13 1.27 .371 Number of clinical trial projects active (log) − 0.04 0.05 .456 − 0.07 0.05 .138 − 0.04 0.05 .383 R&D intensity 0.44 0.50 .376 0.44 0.46 .345 0.60 0.46 .193 Unabsorbed slack 0.00 0.00 .007 0.00 0.00 .024 0.00 0.00 .119 Absorbed slack − 0.07 0.38 .847 − 0.01 0.02 .670 − 0.01 0.03 .731 Potential slack − 0.03 0.12 .824 − 0.03 0.11 .804 − 0.04 0.12 .739 Firm age − 0.18 0.46 .698 0.01 0.42 .977 − 0.13 0.42 .763 Number of alliances initiated the last 5 years 0.02 0.00 .000 0.01 0.01 .318 0.03 0.00 .000 U.S. headquartered 0.07 0.74 .924 0.47 0.66 .479 0.21 0.65 .749 E.U. headquartered 0.30 0.72 .675 0.39 0.66 .552 0.39 0.66 .549 Number of patented molecules (log) 0.06 0.06 .351 0.08 0.06 .189 0.01 0.06 .802 Performance feedback with primary goal above 0.05 0.03 .052 Inconsistent feedback with primary goal above 0.00 0.02 .871 Consistent positive feedback 0.00 0.00 .008 Constant 4.23 11.37 .710 − 0.94 10.40 .928 3.10 10.33 .764 Observations 2,370 2,370 2,370 Log likelihood − 2,979.29 − 2,901.59 − 2,894.19 20 Journal of Management need to be terminated because they unexpectedly exhibit safety issues that only get noticed at these later stages.

Our results show that, taken by itself, low performance on a primary goal is related to an increased focus on distal search in both the technological and orga- nizational dimensions, but this relationship changes when a secondary goal is taken into consid- eration. When performance on a primary goal is low, and performance on a secondary goal is high, the focus on distal search declines, indicating that organizations put more effort into ﬁ nding solutions that draw on internal resources and technologies familiar to their previous activities. This evidence that high performance on a secondary goal alters the direction of responses to low performance on a primary goal extends research on self-enhancement and learning from performance feedback (Audia & Greve, 2021; Jordan & Audia, 2012). Indeed, to our knowledge, this is the  ﬁ rst study that proposes and shows a link between situations of performance ambiguity that foster self-enhancement and the choice of the locus of search.

Theoretical Implications," Our arguments and results add to several streams of research on  ﬁ rm responses to perfor- mance feedback. We contribute to studies that examine the relationship between performance feedback on multiple goals and search. Our arguments and results align with and extend the multiple-goal model recently proposed by Audia and Greve (2021), which suggests that con- sidering multiple goals is central to a broader explanation of how organizations utilize perfor- mance feedback to regulate behavior. Some related research has recently started to examine behavioral responses to multiple goals (e.g., Gaba & Greve, 2019; Hu & Bettis, 2018; Mazzelli et al., 2019), but it has remained silent on whether and how performance feedback in ﬂ uences the locus of search choices. Our study suggests that multiple goals are of particular importance in explaining the locus of search and, therefore, future research on search should take into account performance feedback regarding constellations of goals. More speci ﬁ cally, our study relates to and extends research that has examined the effects of inconsistent performance feedback on search. While inconsistent feedback may arise from multiple goals, it may also be the result of different performance referents (e.g., social vs. his- torical aspirations) or different reference points (e.g., aspirations vs. survival points). Prior research has mainly suggested that such inconsistent performance feedback affects search intensity (Blagoeva et al., 2020; Kostopoulos et al., 2023; Lucas et al., 2018). Our theory and results complement these studies by highlighting a second equally important effect on the locus of search that calls attention to the value of looking beyond search intensity to understand the complex effects of inconsistent feedback. Building further on this line of reasoning, our study adds to our understanding of the spe- ci ﬁ c locus of search choices. In particular, by theorizing and testing different (local vs. distal) loci of search choices we show that performance feedback has a more complex and more nuanced relationship with search than previously thought. Importantly, focusing on perfor- mance on a single (primary) goal alone — as most prior work linking performance feedback to locus of search has done — would leave an important source of heterogeneity regarding locus of search hidden. Our study shows that an understanding of the link between perfor- mance and locus of search bene ﬁ ts from considering the constellation of performance feed- back on multiple goals because organizations may search locally or distally depending upon different constellations. Zooming into the different dimensions of the locus of search, our results add new empirical insights to performance feedback theory. While Cyert and March ’ s (1963) discussion of the locus of search introduced multiple dimensions (e.g., locus relative to existing activities and therefore related knowledge and technologies, and locus relative to the unit where the problem occurs), later research has mostly focused on the idea of familiarity either in terms of familiar versus unfamiliar external partners or related or unrelated acquisitions (Baum et al., 2005; Iyer et al., 2019; Kavusan & Frankort, 2019). Drawing upon insights from research on techno- logical search (Rosenkopf & Nerkar, 2001; Rothaermel & Alexandre, 2009), we offer new empirical evidence in support of a broader range of locus of search choices proposed in the orig- inal BTOF (Cyert & March, 1963): Our  ﬁ ndings show that organizations respond to perfor- mance feedback with changes in the locus of search along not only the technological dimension, which aligns with the concept of familiarity, but also along the organizational dimension, which focuses on the locus relative to  ﬁ rm boundaries. Keil et al. / (In)Consistent Performance Feedback and the Locus of Search 23 Our  ﬁ ndings further extend research on self-enhancement and learning from performance feedback in two distinct ways. First, the available evidence pointing to self-enhancing responses to performance feedback comes from studies at the organizational level of analysis (Blagoeva et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2018) and at the individual level (Audia & Brion, 2007; Audia, Brion, & Greve, 2015). Previous work has not directly addressed self-enhancement in the context of subunits subject to accountability pressures arising from hierarchical control that may eliminate the discretion necessary to form self-enhancing assessments of perfor- mance. Indeed, Jordan and Audia (2012) identi ﬁ ed accountability pressures as a condition that deters a self-enhancement orientation. While more empirical work is needed to tackle this issue (Audia & Greve, 2021), our  ﬁ ndings provide rare evidence of self-enhancement in the context of subunit activities. Second, and more importantly, we show a new modality by which self-enhancement may in ﬂ uence response to performance feedback. While previous work on learning from perfor- mance emphasizes reduced responsiveness to low performance as a key manifestation of self- enhancement (e.g., Audia & Brion, 2007; Joseph & Gaba, 2015), we report a different and so far unexplored effect when considering multiple goals whereby self-enhancement directs locus of search choices and related responses to inconsistent performance signals towards less distal (more local) technological and organizational domains. In this way, our theoretical and empirical analyses indicate that a self-enhancing response may not only mean less change, as previous research has suggested, but could also mean guiding decision-makers ’ search to (less distal) solutions that reinforce their image of competence. The ambiguity gen- erated by performance inconsistency allows organizations to assess and reprioritize their locus of search choices, instead of only changing emphasis from the poor-performing primary goal to the secondary goal that shows high performance, and thus still continue sol- ution search but towards more familiar and less risky locations. In other words, performance feedback along multiple goals and self-enhancement are not only important in triggering more or less search but also in affecting the direction of search among alternatives, an important aspect of  ﬁ rm responses to performance feedback that has received less attention in the liter- ature but is central to understanding  ﬁ rm responses (Keil, Posen, & Workiewicz, 2022). Taken together, our arguments and results indicate that self-enhancement may play an even more central role in how organizations and their decision-makers respond to perfor- mance feedback, suggesting the need for additional theoretical and empirical research on this construct."
Limitations and Future Research," Some limitations to our research must be acknowledged. Although the strength of our empirical approach is the ability to track a large number of drug candidates for an important group of incumbent pharmaceutical companies across an entire multiyear clinical trials pipe- line, this approach did not allow us to collect detailed information on individual  ﬁ rms, such as the full details of the R&D process (beyond the clinical trials) or the decision-making details for individual projects. Future research should therefore attempt to extend our study through careful, in-depth, qualitative work that could further elucidate how organizations process information from the performance of a portfolio of projects or even individual projects and, in turn, use this information to steer the overall R&D process. 24 Journal of Management A second limitation of our study is that we began the examination of the R&D process after the patenting of new drug candidates. The performance feedback we investigated in this study may also have implications for the management of activities that precede the selection of pat- ented molecules for preclinical trials. However, systematic information about these basic research and scienti ﬁ c activities is not publicly available and is therefore dif ﬁ cult to collect longitudinally for a large number of  ﬁ rms. Qualitative research may thus be useful to extend the investigation of the effects of performance feedback even earlier in the R&D process and to examine how performance at the late stages affects decision-making in these very early R&D stages."

Notes," 1. While self-enhancement implies that decision-makers prioritize their self-image in decision-making, this does not automatically imply that decisions made with a self-enhancement motive are negative for organizational per- formance, as both Jordan and Audia (2012) and the recent paper by Levinthal and Rerup (2021) suggest. 2. To minimize potential survivor bias, we sampled pharmaceutical companies at the beginning of the study period (i.e., in 1993). 3. Results were nearly identical if in the calculation of the historical aspirations we weighted recent perfor- mance more heavily or if we simply used the previous year ’ s performance as a proxy. Also, our results were robust to any a 2  greater than 0.35 and lower than 0.96. 4. We also note that the same analysis (i.e., with the count dependent variables) using the OLS panel data pro- vided similar results."
