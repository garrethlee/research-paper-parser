Abstract,"Abstract People are increasingly turning to social media and online forums like Reddit to cope with work-related concerns. Pre- vious research suggests that how others respond can be an important determinant of the sharer’s affective and well- being outcomes. However, less is known about whether and how cues embedded in the content of what is shared can shape the type of responses that one receives from oth- ers, obscuring the joint and interactive role that both the sharer and listener may play in influencing the sharer’s out- comes. In this study, we develop theory to advance our understanding of online coping with an explicitly social focus using computational grounded theorizing and machine learning (ML) techniques applied to a large corpus of work- related conversations on Reddit. Specifically, our theoretical model sheds light on the dynamics of the online social cop- ing process related to the domain of work. We show that how sharers and listeners interact and react to one another depends on the content of stressors shared, the social coping behaviors used when sharing, and whether the sharer and listener belong to the same occupational context. We con- tribute to the social coping literature in three ways. First, we clarify how social actors respond to cues embedded in the social coping attempt. Second, we examine the moderating role that such responses play in shaping sharer outcomes.

1 INTRODUCTION,"1 INTRODUCTION “The nurses are pissed, management is overwhelmed and everything is fucked” —Anonymous Reddit user (ID 85327) The workplace generates a great deal of stress for many people. According to a survey of US employees, 66% identified the work domain as a significant source of stress, more than any other source (American Psychological Asso- ciation,  2021 ). Employees can cope with work-related stressors by sharing and discussing them with others (Baer et al., 2018 ; Baranik et al.,  2017 ; Knipfer & Kump,  2022 ), and, mirroring broader trends in computer-mediated communica- tion, employees are increasingly turning to social media as a way to cope (Lee,  2020 ; Miles & Mangold,  2014 ). This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated common work-related stressors including job insecurity (Lin et al.,  2021 ), heavy workloads (Shao et al.,  2021 ), and work-family conflict (Vaziri et al.,  2020 ). Social coping , or relying on others to help manage demands that one appraises as taxing or exceeding resources, can assume various forms (Carver et al.,  1989 ; Lazarus & Folkman,  1984 ). Two of the most relevant forms to online work-related conversations are: (a) informational support-seeking, where one seeks advice or information from others (Carver et al.,  1989 ; House et al.,  1985 ) and (b) emotional social sharing, where one expresses negative emotions to others in an attempt to vent, or “offload” the emotion, or to garner emotional support (Brown et al.,  2005 ; Carver et al.,  1989 ; Rimé,  2009 ; Rosen et al.,  2021 ). Although these literatures have produced a number of important insights, they tend to focus considerably more on the focal person engaging in coping than on the role that the social context may play (Revenson & Lepore,  2012 ). However, organizational research has recently started to incorporate theoretical nuance into this process by seeking to understand how the listener’s approach to the interaction influences outcomes for the person engaging in coping. For example, Behfar et al. ( 2020 ) found that responding to emotional venting with a “challenging” response can improve problem solving outcomes for the person engaging in venting. In another study, employees engaging in “unfairness talk” about their supervisors were more likely to experience hope, and less likely to experience anger when coworkers employed a “reframing” response (Baer et al.,  2018 ). These kinds of models, which explicitly account for the role of the social environment, may help to clarify mixed find- ings in the literature around the effectiveness of certain coping behaviors. One limitation of these studies, however, is that they tend to treat the response from the listener as exogenous to the social interaction, potentially obscuring how the interaction itself might shape the response, and highlighting how the listener  should  respond but not nec- essarily how they  do  respond. In other words, we argue that the listener’s response is likely influenced by cues in the conversation, such as the nature of the stressor that is prompting the need to cope and the type of social coping behavior employed. Framing this process more as a dynamic conversation would enable us to explore how the listener responds to these cues from the sharer and how the joint effect of both the sharer’s social coping behavior and the listener responses relate to the sharer’s outcomes. We construe social coping as a process whereby one party (here- after the “sharer”) shares information about work-related stressors and attempts to cope with them, another party SAJJADIANI  ET AL    . 3    (hereafter the “listener”) responds with a comment, and this ultimately relates to the affective outcomes of the sharer. This approach could yield novel theoretical insights about the nature of these conversations, potentially shedding light on interventions to improve them. Additionally, much of the previous research on social coping in the organizational literature takes a narrower, more isolated approach to the role of stressors (e.g., difficult customers; McCance et al.,  2013 ) and responses from interac- tion partners (e.g., reframing; Baer et al.,  2018 ), which limits our ability to theoretically integrate findings that assess these relationships across studies. Stress and coping theorists emphasize that specific coping behaviors can help peo- ple navigate specific situations that people appraise as threatening (Chronister & Chan,  2007 ; Krohne,  2001 ). Thus, to better understand this process through an interactive lens, we believe that a more contextual and inductive account of stressors and responses is necessary. Finally, most organizational research on social coping involves face-to-face interactions with others in the work- place or with personal confidants outside of the workplace. These pre-existing relationships feature social norms that dictate many aspects of the social coping process, from the candor with which sharers may discuss the details of their work experience to the emotions they convey and the type of response the listener employs (Behfar et al.,  2020 ). With the ubiquity of social media, sharing one’s views and experiences is increasingly less confined to interaction partners with whom one has an existing relationship (Choi & Toma,  2014 ). This reality presents an opportunity to study how people seek and provide support with anonymous strangers in a virtual setting, where authentic emotions and con- cerns are more readily expressed due to a reduced fear of reprisals (Corritore et al.,  2020 ; Kafetsios et al.,  2017 ). Thus, we answer recent calls in the literature suggesting that, “one particularly promising path for expanding the scope of social support research would be to investigate the role that social network use (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook) plays in providing social support in a work context or to individuals seeking support for work issues” (Jolly et al.,  2021 , p. 244). We address these oversights in the social coping literature by using a grounded theorizing approach (Strauss & Corbin,  1998 ) to develop theory of the work-related online social coping process, using interpretive data science (Nelson,  2020 ). We apply several machine learning (ML) and text analysis techniques to code elements of conver- sations between users on Reddit, a popular social networking site where people share and discuss their thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Through an inductive analysis of these rich textual data, we develop theory to enable a deeper understanding of the online social coping process and to spur additional organizational scholarship on this important phenomenon. Our analysis identified a number of theoretically-meaningful patterns that we formulated into testable proposi- tions. We found that listeners seem to respond to two different independent cues embedded in the sharer’s post: the work-related stressors described and the approach the sharer to cope with those stressors. For example, the type of strategy listeners employ, like providing information or socioemotional support, may be influenced by the occupational specificity of the stressor, the degree of information-seeking conveyed in the post, the degree of certainty or motiva- tional state conveyed by the expression of discrete emotions, and whether the sharer and listener come from the same occupational category. In addition, we found that the sharer’s affective reactions to this conversation depend on the interaction between the specific coping behaviors they employed and the responses listeners offered. For example, we found that the deleterious effect of expressing anger is exacerbated when the listener provides informational support and the adaptive effect of expressing fear is enhanced when the listener offers a new perspective that helps reframe the sharer’s problem. Taken together, our study makes three theoretical contributions. First, we contribute to theory on the enactment of support in a social coping context by providing a more integrated and comprehensive account of the cues that listeners use in formulating their response to sharers. Second, we contribute to the nascent body of research on the impor- tant role that listener responses play in modulating the effectiveness of social coping behaviors. Taken together with insights on the effects of social coping behaviors on listener responses, this highlights the dual roles that social coping behaviors play—to help the sharer cope with the stressor directly and to marshal resources from others—and we show how one can enhance, or offset, the effects of the other. Third, we extend theory on work-related social coping to the 4 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .

1.1 Developing theory on the social nature of online coping,"1.1 Developing theory on the social nature of online coping We rely on a variation of the classic grounded theory methodology by Glaser and Strauss ( 1967 ), sometimes referred to as “grounded theorizing” (Holton,  2018 ). In grounded theorizing, a theory-neutral, clean-slate start is considered to be impossible and instead adopting existing theoretical frameworks informed by extant research is prescribed (Part- ington,  2002 ). We integrate the Transactional Model of Stress (Lazarus & Folkman,  1984 ) with extant research on social support (see Bavik et al.,  2020  for a review) to inform a model of the online social coping process (see Figure  1 ). Applied to the online context, these theories suggest that there are three primary components of online social cop- ing in rough temporal order. First, someone decides to write a post about a work-related stressor that is appraised as threatening or exceeding available resources. The post typically includes both a description of the situation/event and evidence for the way in which the sharer is using social media to cope with it (e.g., to solicit information or to vent negative emotions). Second, listeners respond to the post. Finally, the sharer experiences some affective reaction to this conversation, which is reflected in the sharer’s subsequent reactions to the listener’s response. Figure  1  shows the conceptual model of this process, which guides our research questions and subsequent analyses."
1.2 Work-related stressors and social coping behaviors,"1.2 Work-related stressors and social coping behaviors Work-related stressors refer to demands or events requiring people to adjust their usual behavior patterns related to work (Frone et al.,  1995 ; Sonnentag,  2018 ) such as work pressure, lack of autonomy, and role ambiguity (Frone et al.,  1995 ). When confronted with stressors that people appraise as taxing or threatening, they can employ several coping behaviors to reduce the adverse effects of those stressors (Lazarus & Folkman,  1984 ). Many of these coping behaviors can be employed when one is alone, however, some coping behaviors inherently require the aid of someone else as a resource, referred to as social coping (Carver et al.,  1989 ). As social creatures, people are likely to turn to their social environment during difficult times, as exemplified by the well-known “tend and befriend theory” (Taylor,  2011 ). For example, Yang et al. ( 2021 ) found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, employees experiencing stressors of job insecurity or remote work were more likely to reach out to dormant ties. We focus on two social coping behaviors that have been investigated in the literature: (a)  informational support seeking  and (b)  emotional social sharing . Informational support seeking is a problem-focused coping behavior that is commonly used on social media (Frison & Eggermont,  2015 ; Wang et al.,  2015 ) and refers to asking for information or advice from others, which can be used to alter one’s behaviors to accomplish goals and solve problems (Taylor et al., SAJJADIANI  ET AL    . 5    2004 ). Emotional social sharing, whereby individuals communicate openly with one another regarding the circum- stancessurroundingtheemotion-evokingevent,andtheirownfeelingsandemotions(Rimé,  2009 ),isanothercommon form of social coping, and one that is also often used on social media (Vermeulen et al.,  2018 ; Wang et al.,  2015 ). This is an emotion-focused coping behavior because the intent is typically either to garner sympathy or comfort from the social interaction or to reduce the experience of the emotion by venting it to others (Brown et al.,  2005 ). Although most often associated with expressions of anger, emotional social sharing can include other emotions as well (Brans et al.,  2014 ; Luo et al.,  2020 )."
1.3 Listener responses as a function of sharer cues,"1.3 Listener responses as a function of sharer cues Sharing stressful work situations with others can invite a range of responses and a number of different models in the literature have attempted to capture these responses. For example, House and colleagues developed a model of social support, which includes emotional, informational, appraisal, and instrumental support (House et al.,  1988 ). Nils and Rimé ( 2012 ) focused on a socio-affective (empathic) mode and a cognitive (reframing) mode as possible responses to the shared emotion of others. Some conceptualizations also recognize that the response may not always be positive or supportive, such as Barbee and Cunningham’s taxonomy ( 1995 ), which also features dismissing or avoiding the sharer as key dimensions. Despite this rich body of research on the ways in which people respond to those in need, less is known about the role that the sharer plays in garnering these responses. The majority of the research in this area tends to treat social support as exogenous and assumes that the sharer is simply a passive recipient of support (Feeney & Collins,  2015 ; Forest et al.,  2021 ). However, it is likely that the content of the sharer’s message plays a role in how the listener responds. Recent theoretical advances in social support suggest that the type of support offered is a function of both the “life adversity” of the recipient and the recipient’s response to that life adversity (Feeney & Collins,  2015 ), which is conceptually similar to work-related stressors and social coping behaviors, respectively. Drawing from this, we posit that the nature of the work-related stressor and the type of social coping behavior employed may be cues that relate to how the listener responds. A few studies have investigated this proposition. First, there is some work on how social support is provisioned on the basis of sharer cues, largely among confidants like romantic couples, families, and friends. Some of this work focuses on how the nature of the stressor (Horowitz et al.,  2001 ; Lindorff,  2005 ) or the social coping behavior (Cutrona et al.,  2007 ; Horowitz et al.,  2001 ) relates to the type of support received. Although useful, these studies produce a fragmented picture of how listeners respond to sharer cues as they tend to limit social support behaviors to a few broad categories, like informational vs. emotional support, and they very rarely include cues related to the stressors and social coping behaviors in the same model (see Horowitz et al.,  2001 ; Study 2 for an exception). This obscures a broader theoretical understanding of the myriad ways that listeners respond to these different sets of cues, which are likely present at the same time in the social interaction. In addition, these studies tend to focus on in-person interac- tions with others, which may overlook subtle differences in how listeners respond online. For example, research shows that greater social distance between the parties affects the type of support offered (Rim & Summerville,  2014 ). Finally, almost no research has examined these relationships in the work context (see Lindorff,  2005  for a notable exception). A second body of work has investigated how listeners respond to support-seeking communications in online forums. Some of the research in this domain has examined how listeners respond to stressor and social coping behavior cues embedded in the sharer’s post (e.g., Pan et al.,  2018 ; Wang et al.,  2015 ). However, these studies tend to focus on a few broad types of social coping and/or a single specific type of listener response (e.g., Pan et al.,  2018 ), with some oper- ationalizing support as simply liking or re-sharing the help-seeking post (Luo et al.,  2020 ). In addition, many of these studies gather data from online forums dedicated to specific issues, like certain health problems (e.g., Rains et al.,  2015 ) or addictions (e.g., Liu et al.,  2017 ). The nature of sharing and responding in these forums may be different than what occurs on Reddit, where people likely discuss a much broader set of interests and where the participants may be less aligned on any given topic. Despite the importance of employee online complaints in organizational research (Miles & 6 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .    Mangold,  2014 ), we know very little about what drives listener responses to these online discussions of work-related problems. Research Question 1 : How do the cues related to (a) different types of work-related stressors and (b) social coping behaviors relate to the types of responses received?"
1.4 The importance of who responds,"1.4 The importance of who responds Much of the preceding discussion implies that listeners may try to infer the needs, goals, or preferences of sharers based on the cues related to the stressor and social coping behaviors, which influence how they will respond. The ability and motivation of the listener to make those inferences and respond in specific ways, however, likely differs as a function of the shared perspective and understanding of the stressor context between the two parties. As such, we also investigate the role of the occupational context match, or the degree to which the sharer and listener work in a similar occupational context, as a proxy for this shared understanding. Typically, sharers choose the partners with whom they will seek information or express their negative emotions, with research suggesting that sharers choose listeners with whom they are more closely attached and interact more frequently for support (Kammrath et al.,  2020 ). They also tend to seek out listeners who are more supportive and who are viewed as having relevant expertise (Behfar et al.,  2020 ). However, online social coping drastically reduces this ability to choose one’s interaction partner. Particularly in forums like Reddit, which are relatively anonymous and open to anyone who is a member of the site, sharers have access to a diverse pool of listeners; thus, even when they share in a more specialized subreddit, they cannot ensure they will receive response from a supportive listener with relevant expertise. This presents an opportunity to explore how people with more dissimilar occupational backgrounds may respond to the cues embedded in the sharer’s post differently than those from more similar backgrounds. There are several possibilities regarding the moderating role of occupational context match. Social identity plays an important role in determining helping behavior (e.g., Levine et al.,  2005 ) and people tend to experience more empa- thy in response to the stressful events of ingroup members and more schadenfreude for the problems of outgroup members (Cikara et al.,  2011 ). Similarly, listeners from the same occupational context may have more nuanced insight about certain problems faced, which may influence the type of response they give relative to someone from a different occupational context. Conversely, as suggested by the advantages of knowledge dissimilarity between actors in social capital research (Ter Wal et al.,  2016 ), listeners from different occupational contexts may see the problem from a dif- ferent or fresh perspective and formulate high-quality support. As such, we aim to identify the role that occupational context match plays in influencing how listeners respond to the cues in the sharer’s post. Research Question 2 : Does the occupational context match between the sharer and listenermoderate how listeners respond to (a) the sharer’s work-related stressors and (b) social coping behaviors?"
1.5 Sharer’s subsequent reactions,"1.5 Sharer’s subsequent reactions The literature on social coping has produced mixed findings in terms of the effect of specific coping behaviors on affect and well-being. For example, research suggests that informational support seeking is generally associated with adap- tive outcomes in the workplace (e.g., Nifadkar et al.,  2019 ). Meanwhile, the findings for emotional social sharing are more mixed, but many studies suggest that it exacerbates strain and inhibits emotional recovery for employees (Baer et al.,  2018 ; Brown et al.,  2005 ; Bushman et al.,  2001 ; Day & Livingstone,  2001 ; see McCance et al.,  2013  for a notable exception). Similarly, using a combined measure of informational and emotional social coping, Kim et al. ( 2006 ) found SAJJADIANI  ET AL    . 7    conflicting results regarding the success of coping across different populations. To reconcile inconsistent findings in this literature, recent research has begun to investigate the active role of the listener in this process. Empirical research and theory in the social support literature suggests that the effectiveness of social support from listeners depends on its fit with the needs or goals of the person receiving support. For instance, Horowitz et al. ( 2001 ) argued that various forms of listener responses were most effective when they matched the coping goal or the problems of the sharer. Specifically, they found that sharers reported the highest satisfaction when they shared an action-related problem (i.e., a performance failure) and the listener provided actionable plans in response, or when sharers described an emotionally distressing event (i.e., a romantic breakup) and the listener demonstrated under- standing and empathy. However, in another study, coworkers displaying understanding and validation of the sharer’s affect-laden thoughts about an unfair supervisor related to more negative emotions, whereas cognitively reframing the unfairness situation reduced anger (Baer et al.,  2018 ). In a similar vein, both experimental and qualitative research has shown that challenging the sharer’s initial premise provided new insight and led to better responses and outcomes for the sharer in not only face-to-face (Behfar et al.,  2020 ) but also online settings (Meurer et al.,  2022 ). These studies show that listener responses matter with regard to how social coping behaviors relate to the affective outcomes of sharers. However, there is conflicting evidence about the nature of the effects that listener responses have. In part, this may be due to the fact that these studies are often conducted on only one or a few types of listener responses (e.g., instrumental vs. emotional) and in the context of a single stressor (e.g., supervisor unfairness), which limits a more integrated theoretical understanding of how listener responses play a role in this process. This motivates us to explore the effect of several listener responses on the relationship between social coping behaviors and sharer affective reactions, while also accounting for the broader context of work-related stressors. Research Question 3 : How do listener responses and their interactions with social coping behaviors relate to the sharer’s affective reaction?"
2 METHOD,"2 METHOD To answer our research questions, we used computational grounded theorizing—a variation of the classic grounded theory methodology (Holton,  2018 ). In grounded theorizing, scholars adopt a theoretical framework that informs their research because they do not consider a theory-neutral state to be possible (Partington,  2002 ). We used the theory- derived model illustrated in Figure  1  to inform our approach to analyzing the data. In particular, we used this model to guide the types of categories we coded in the data (e.g., the specific work-related stressors, social coping behaviors, and listener responses), using computational methods to quantify the unstructured text into several variables (Nelson, 2020 ). Next, we used this model to determine the specific quantitative relationships between those variables that we would analyze and subsequently interpret using an inductive approach. These patterns of quantitative relationships between key variables in our model represent what Puranam and colleagues call “stylized facts,” which are important building blocks for theory-building in quantitative induction (Puranam et al.,  2018 ). Below, we explain our methods, starting with the data collection and then the process of quantifying the data into various categories."
2.1 Data collection,"2.1 Data collection We collected data from the online community, Reddit. People use Reddit to post content and interact with others in “subreddits,” which operate like message forums organized around specific interests or topics (e.g., the “working- moms” subreddit). When others come across these posts, they can choose to respond to them, or to the responses of others, which often creates a series of distinct conversations that operate in parallel under the original post. Unlike other social media platforms like Twitter, which restricts the number of characters that can be used in a single post 8 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .    (280), Reddit’s character limit is high (40,000), which tends to encourage rich discussions between the participants. In addition, Reddit users often contribute to the discussion under aliases and do not need to send and accept “friend requests” with other users to engage with one another (in contrast to the usual practice in other social networks like Facebook). These features mean that the discussions on Reddit are often among anonymous strangers who only share some interest in the topics discussed. We collected three datasets from Reddit using the official Reddit application programming interface (API). Our first dataset, “Dataset 1” consisted of conversations from January 2020 to January 2022, including the original posts (hereafter, “the posts”) and responses to them (hereafter, “the responses”) that were related to work and workers’ experiences. The API does not allow for wide-scale text scraping of the website and limits keyword searches to specific subreddits. We decided to search subreddits that functioned as general discussion boards (e.g., askreddit), special- ized support groups (e.g., workingmoms), work-related subreddits (e.g., work, jobs), advice-centered subreddits (e.g., careerguidance), subreddits in which people might vent about work (e.g., antiwork), or in which users vent in general (e.g., vent), as well as occupation-specific subreddits (e.g., teachers, nursing). We searched these subreddits for posts and responses containing the keywords, “work,” “job,” “office,” “position,” “laid,” “layoff,” “furlough,” “employ,” “manager,” “boss,” “colleague,” OR “career.” Our search was not case sensitive and also included other words that might contain these keywords (e.g., “worker” contains the word “work”). To complete the keyword list, we followed an iterative process that involved brainstorming an initial set of keywords, searching for posts that included these initial keywords, and then, reading random samples of these posts with the goal of finding more potential keywords that can be included in the keyword list. Given that our study aims to understand the interac- tive process of online social coping, we only kept conversations that had at least one response. This step resulted in a dataset (hereafter, Dataset 1) with 21,990 conversations, including 313,524 posts and responses, by 102,279 unique individuals (hereafter, the Redditors) in 18 subreddits (see Table  S1  in the online supplementary document for the full list). Dataset 2 consists of the activity report of Redditors whose posts were represented in Dataset 1. These data show in which subreddits a Redditor was active (e.g., Redditor  X  was active in the “nursing” and “workingmom” subreddits). Because it reflects the Redditors’ interests, Dataset 2, along with Dataset 3 introduced next, helped us to catego- rize the Redditors’ occupational contexts. Dataset 3 consists of all posts by the Redditors represented in Dataset 1, posted in any subreddit about any topic. Before analyzing the data, we first followed Hickman et al.’s ( 2022 ) recom- mendationsandpre-processedourtextualdata.Inparticular,weconvertedthedatatolowercase,removedstopwords (common words, such as “a,” “the,” “is,” “are”), posts by bots, words that were repeated in the data fewer than five times (usually typos or proper nouns), and posts with fewer than 10 words."
2.2 Overview of ML methods used,"2.2 Overview of ML methods used To translate the unstructured textual data into meaningful constructs, we used interpretive data science, which is a combination of qualitative analysis of the text and ML techniques. In this process, we used three ML techniques, including unsupervised and supervised learning, and word embedding. We first give a high-level overview of these ML techniques before explaining how they were employed to operationalize the specific constructs in our study. The basic steps of these methods are summarized in Figure  2 . ML code is available at this Open Science Framework (OSF) link: https://osf.io/eytjr/?view_only=6fc0dc7328464540ae7aa963f3133f9e ."
2.3 Unsupervised machine learning,"2.3 Unsupervised machine learning We used topic modeling, an unsupervised ML technique, to understand the nature of the work-related stressors shared on Reddit. Unlike supervised learning methods that assume a predefined set of categories into which data are SAJJADIANI  ET AL    . 9    FIGURE 2 Data analysis processes: supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning classified, topic modeling is an unsupervised clustering method in ML used to find latent topics in unstructured textual data (DiMaggio et al.,  2013 ; Mohr & Bogdanov,  2013 ). These topics often represent the underlying meanings of the group of texts that belong to that topic. As such, topic modeling is a dimension reduction method similar to principal component analysis (PCA). In topic modeling, similar to PCA, the number of topics need to be decided in advance. We compared the performance of three topic modeling methods, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei et al.,  2003 ), Non- Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF; Lee & Seung,  1999 ), and Structural Topic Modeling (STM; Roberts et al.,  2019 ) to select the model that performed best (for technical details please see Appendix  A )."
2.4 Supervised machine learning,"2.4 Supervised machine learning To identify social coping behaviors, listener responses, and redditors’ occupations we used supervised ML. The goal of supervised ML is to train an algorithm using a labeled sample to accurately label (categorize) the remaining unlabeled data (prediction sample). Before applying the trained algorithm to the prediction sample, one needs to ensure the algo- rithm is reliable and valid. To classify our data into the categories of interest (our study constructs), we first randomly divided data into two parts: (a) the ground truth sample, which includes a small random sample of Reddit posts that we manually label through qualitative coding into the categories of interest, and (b) the prediction sample, which includes the remaining unlabeled data. We used the ground truth sample to train, test, and validate the algorithms, so it must be as precise and accurate as possible (Tay et al.,  2021 ). These categories of interest reflect the constructs in our study. For example, in the case of social coping behaviors, we categorized (labeled) a sample of the data into three labels: Informational Support Seeking, Emotional Social Sharing, and General Opinion/Other. To create a ground truth sample, we hired research assistants (RAs) and trained them to label the data (details dis- cussed later). The next step was to randomly divide the  ground truth  sample into three parts:  training ,  test , and  validation samples. We used the labeled data in the  training  dataset to train and tune multiple ML algorithms and compared and optimized their performance in categorizing (labeling) the data, by applying the trained algorithms to the  test  dataset. The algorithms we used, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression, are known for classifying textual data (James et al.,  2013 ; Kowsari et al.,  2019 ). We evaluated the performance of the 10 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .    algorithms using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics, which are commonly used to evaluate algorithm performance (Nelson et al.,  2021 ; van Rijsbergen,  1979 ). Next, we applied the algorithm with the highest level of accuracy and F1 score (the harmonic meanofprecisionand recall) onthe validationsample toensure the algorithm performsaccurately beyond the test sample. This step ensures that the selected algorithm is not simply fine-tuned to either the  training  or test  datasets, and that the algorithm can accurately label new datasets. Consistency of the accuracy metrics across different algorithms indicates inter-algorithm reliability, which is similar to inter-rater reliability and the algorithms’ accuracy in classifying the validation sample indicates their validity (Sajjadiani et al.,  2019 ). After validating the algo- rithm, we applied it to the unlabeled  prediction  dataset to label the remaining data that we did not manually label into the categories of interest. This process is summarized in Figure  2 . In this study, we specifically used the multi-label classification technique, in which labels are not mutually exclu- sive. To do so, we converted the labeled dataset into multiple single-labeled datasets to transform the multi-label classification into multiple binary classifications (Brucker et al.,  2011 ; Liu & Tsoumakas,  2020 ; Tsoumakas & Katakis, 2007 )."
2.5 Word embedding,"2.5 Word embedding To measure expressed emotions and affective reactions in the posts, we used word embedding to quantify the extent to which a text is similar to certain concepts of interest. In this study we use two types of word embedding models: (1) Word2Vec (Mikolov et al.,  2013 ), which we use to measure how much the texts were similar to certain concepts of interest, and (2) BERT, a deep learning transformer model (BERT; Devlin et al.,  2019 ), which we use to measure basic emotions in the text. The technical details are provided in Appendix  A ."
2.6 Identifying work-related original posts,"2.6 Identifying work-related original posts Given that the goal of this study is to understand social coping with work-related stressors, we first needed to identify and delete the posts that were not work-related. We trained the RAs to categorize a random subset of 1000 original posts using a dummy variable indicating whether the post is work-related or not. We then applied supervised ML, as explained above, to categorize the data into work-related and non-work-related posts. This process accurately labeled whether the posts were work-related, as agreement between the manually labeled data and machine labeled data in the validation sample was 98%. Given that the goal of this study is to understand social coping with work-related stressors, we deleted the posts that were not categorized as work-related."
2.7 Identification and operationalization of constructs,"2.7 Identification and operationalization of constructs Next, we will introduce each of the main elements of the online conversation that are shown in Figure  1 . We will explain how we used ML and qualitative coding techniques to identify and operationalize the constructs within each element and provide evidence of the reliability and validity of these measurement techniques. These methods are summarized in Table  1 ."
2.8 Sharer’s work-related stressors,"2.8 Sharer’s work-related stressors To identify the content of the work-related stressors discussed in the posts, we used unsupervised ML to clus- ter the posts by their overall topic. We ran LDA, NMF, and STM 25 times, starting with a five-topic model, and SAJJADIANI  ET AL    . 11    TABLE 1 Identification and operationalization of constructs Conversation elements ML technique Ground truth sample Reliability Validity Labeled constructs Sharer’s Work-Related Original Posts Supervised Machine Learning Manually labeled posts by RAs Various algorithms classified data similarly.

We evaluated the performance of each model by reading the top 20 posts in each topic, paying attention to the top words and the distribution of top- ics. While all three methods performed similarly and resulted in similar themes (an indicator of the reliability of topic modeling), overall, STM performed better in distinguishing different topics and with fewer topics. Another advantage of STM is that it allows the topics to be correlated. Therefore, we moved forward with an 18-topic STM model. To learn about each topic’s empirical theme, each author and two RAs independently read the top 20 posts in each topic and chose a title that represented the overarching stressor theme. There was generally high similarity in the titles we chose for each topic. For example, one person labeled a topic, “poor management of workplace mistreatment,” whereas another chose “employer mishandling workplace hostility, violence, and other mistreatment,” and another chose “employer mishandling issues related to harassment, violence, or mental health.” We labeled this topic, “Mis- management of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) issues.” The agreement between the coders in identifying the core stressor themes in topics demonstrates the validity of the method in accurately grouping conceptually similar posts together. To further validate the algorithm’s ability to cluster similar posts, we took the top ten words that the algorithm identified as best representing each topic and then added a randomly chosen word from another topic, as an odd- word-out (Chang et al.,  2009 ). Two RAs were then asked to identify in each of the 18 groupings which word did not belong to the set of 11 words, without knowing the common conceptual theme. In each of the 18 samples, the odd-word-out was determined correctly, validating the machine’s ability to group together words under a common conceptual theme. This process led to the following 18 distinct stressor variables: (1) Career Path Ambiguity, (2) Job Search/Application Ambiguity, (3) Concerns about Viability of Quitting, (4) Resignation/Onboarding Process Ambigu- ity, (5) HR/Management-Related Issues, (6) Unemployment Assistance Issues, (7) Inadequacy of Compensation and Benefits, (8) Scheduling Mismanagement, (9) Work-Family Conflict, (10) Disrespectful Workplace Environments, (11) Mismanagement of EDI Issues, (12) Workplace Exploitation, (13) Interpersonal Conflict, (14) Essential Work Con- cerns, (15) Field-Specific Teaching Concerns, (16) Field-Specific Nursing Concerns, (17) Field-Specific Postal Work Concerns, and (18) Retail Worker Concerns. Table  2  shows the topics along with the representative words and a representative post for each topic."
2.9 Sharer’s social coping behaviors,"2.9 Sharer’s social coping behaviors Next, we identified the specific social coping behaviors exhibited by the sharers. To do this, we first started by identifying a broad categorization of social coping behaviors."
2.9.1 Sharer’s Broad Social Coping Behaviors in Original Post,"2.9.1 Sharer’s Broad Social Coping Behaviors in Original Post First, the authors each independently read and coded a random sample of the same 50 posts for cues about the motiva- tion for sharing each experience on Reddit. Sometimes these cues were quite obvious, and the sharer explicitly stated the intent (e.g., “I just want to vent” or “I’m looking for some advice”). In other cases, the behavior was more subtle and had to be inferred by the entire context of the post. We then compared our codes and discussed any discrep- ancies in an effort to reconcile them. Drawing on the coping literature described above, we combined the empirical themes we extracted from the posts and identified two main conceptual categories: (a) seeking informational sup- port through asking for advice, suggestions, or feedback (Informational Support Seeking) and (b) expressing negative emotions about the experience or issue raised (Emotional Social Sharing). In particular, those who engaged in emo- tional social sharing expressed negative feelings of anger, disgust, sadness, or fear associated with the experience, and appeared to do so either to vent those negative emotions or to solicit emotional support. There were also posts that 14 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .

These were categorized into a separate category called Other. Table  3  shows representative posts for each category. We trained the RAs to follow the labeling strategy we used and to categorize a random subset of 1,000 original conversation-starting posts into three dummy variables: (1) Informational Support Seeking, and /or (2) Emotional Social Sharing, and (3) Other. This manually labeled sample constitutes the ground truth sample. Next, we applied supervised ML to train, test, and validate the above-mentioned algorithms and find the best performing algorithm in classifying the posts into the categories of interest. Table  4  shows the performance metrics for the data categorization of each algorithm. We then applied the best performing algorithm to categorize the prediction dataset into the cat- egories of interest. This resulted in 9,371 work-related original posts categorized as Informational Support Seeking and/or Emotional Social Sharing."
2.9.2 Sharer’s Discrete Emotions in Original Post,"2.9.2 Sharer’s Discrete Emotions in Original Post Next, we wanted to further code the posts that contained emotional social sharing by labeling the specific discrete emotions expressed in the post. In particular, we aimed to measure each of the basic negative emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, sadness, and fear; Ekman,  1992, 2000 ). To do this, we compared the performance of two word-embedding methods: Word2Vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The technical details are presented in Appendix  A . To validate the classifications using Word2Vec and BERT, two RAs each independently coded the same random sample of 200 posts for expressions of anger/disgust, 1      sadness, and fear (coded 1 if it contained the emotion and 0 if it did not). The RAs found this more challenging than simply coding for the presence of emotional social sharing. For example, one Redditor lamented “Why I ask is this verbal abuse, is because I am made to genuinely feel awful through- out my day.” (ID 8242). One of our RAs labeled this as anger and the other one labeled it as sadness. Nonetheless, they agreed on 145 of these posts, which we used as our  validation  dataset. We then compared the performance of Word2Vec and BERT with the manual labeling. For this comparison, we dichotomized the Word2Vec output to 1 if the value was positive and 0 otherwise. Table  5  shows the agreements between ML models and the manual labeling. The Word2Vec model outperformed the BERT model, in part because the pre-trained data for fine-tuning the BERT model were derived from Twitter posts (for more details see Appendix  A ), which differ in length and content from Reddit posts. This demonstrates the importance of the ground truth dataset and the need to validate the results with a ground truth sample relevant to the data being analyzed, in the case of using a pre-trained dataset. Based on these findings, we used the Word2Vec model to measure the emotions reflected in the posts."
2.10 Listener responses,"2.10 Listener responses Next, we wanted to identify the types of responses that listeners employ when commenting on the original post of a sharer. To do this, the authors first read and qualitatively coded a random sample of 50 responses. Similar to what we did before, we compared our codes and discussed and reconciled any discrepancies. We identified six rele- vant listener response categories: (a) Informational Support (offering informational support through providing advice, suggestions, feedback, or answering the sharer’s questions); (b) Positive Socioemotional Support (emotionally sup- porting the sharer by empathizing with the sharer (e.g., “I understand you” or “I feel you”); approving of the sharer’s decision/behavior, wishing the sharer luck, and/or expressing appreciation for the sharer’s effort); (c) Negative Socioe- motional Support (validating the sharer’s feelings by blaming other parties such as a customer, manager, organization, or government as the causes of the sharer’s reported problem); (d) Opposition (opposing the sharer’s premise, scolding the sharer, or assigning blame to the sharer for the situation); (e) Reciprocal Sharing (sharing a personal experi- SAJJADIANI  ET AL    . 21    TABLE 3 Examples of social coping behaviors and listener responses Labeled construct Post Irrelevant Posts General Opinion/Other ...

We grouped these remain- ing responses together and labeled this category  Other . Table  2  displays examples of each response category from our data. Next, we selected a random sample of 1,000 responses and asked two RAs to independently categorize them into the six dummy variables representing each category. Each post may belong to more than one category. We compared the performance of (a) supervised ML, (b) word-embedding, and (c) supervised ML augmented with word-embedding in terms of each method’s ability to categorize the data into the response categories (for technical details, please see"
Appendix  A ). The augmented model outperformed the other models. We used the highest performing algorithm (see Table  4 ) to categorize the data in each response category.,Appendix  A ). The augmented model outperformed the other models. We used the highest performing algorithm (see Table  4 ) to categorize the data in each response category.
2.11 Sharer-listener occupational category match,"2.11 Sharer-listener occupational category match Next, we sought to identify whether each sharer-listener pair were part of the same occupational category or not. To classify Redditors into occupations, we first created a ground truth sample by asking the RAs to read a random sample of 200 posts and responses and to record any mentions of the sharers’ or listeners’ occupations. Next, we reviewed this list of occupations and grouped them by similarity into seven categories: (a) healthcare workers, (b) retail workers, (c) educators, (d) food services workers (e) office/corporate workers, (f) other service workers, and (g) unemployed people. To increase the size of the labeled sample we used the regular expression method (Aho,  1991 ) and searched the entire post history of each Redditor (Dataset 3) to find any patterns that revealed the person’s occupational category (e.g., “I work at,” “I [was|am|have been] [laid off|furloughed],” “I [have been|] [work|working],”). Using this method we identified the occupational category of 9,968 more Redditors, which, along with those that were hand coded, resulted in occupational categorizations of 10,168 Redditors. Using Dataset 2, we also know the subreddits in which all of the Redditors in our sample are active, including these newly labeled Redditors. From this we created a ground truth dataset of 10,168 Redditors whose subreddit activities are the features (inputs) and occupational categories are the labels (output). Next, we used random under-sampling to create a balanced dataset of each of the labeled categories to train and test the algorithms. We used the best algorithm to classify the remaining Redditors into the occupational categories (see Table  4  for the performance of each algorithm). With each Redditor classified into an occupational category, we were able to simply code each sharer-listener pair as 1 (same occupational category) or 0 (different occupational categories).

2.12 Sharer’s affective reactions to the responses,"2.12 Sharer’s affective reactions to the responses Finally, we wanted to measure the sharer’s affective reactions to the conversation (hereafter, reactions) in terms of their level of satisfaction and the amount of anger, sadness, and fear reflected in their subsequent posts. To do this, we examined comments by sharers who returned to the conversation and responded with further com- ments or updates. Sharers returned in 6,093 out of 9,371 conversations. 2      We then used the Word2Vec method to measure the degree of satisfaction and discrete emotions (anger, sadness, and fear) reflected in the reactions. For satisfaction, we used the average of the 300-dimensional vectors for “happy” and “satisfied.” For each of the dis- crete emotions, we used the same method that was used previously when labeling the discrete emotions in the original post. These reactions were all averaged at the level of the conversation, representing the average level of the sharer’s affective reaction to the conversation. To validate the Word2Vec approach, our RAs categorized a random sample of 300 reaction posts based on whether they seemed to reflect satisfaction with the conver- sation and whether the reactions seemed to reflect anger, sadness, or fear (all coded 1 for yes and 0 for no). The inter-rater reliability was high ( α satisfaction     =  83%,  α anger     =  86%,  α sadness     =  82%,  α fear     =  90%). In addition, the agreement between the manually labeled reactions (where there was consensus between the three RAs) and the algorithmically labeled reactions were strong: 82% for satisfaction, 86.1% for anger, 92.3% for sadness, and 87% for fear. It should be noted that using algorithms to measure individuals’ felt emotions through online posts has been previously debated. For example, Kross et al. ( 2019 ) evaluated whether the emotion words used in Facebook posts can accurately represent felt emotions. They did so by comparing the performance of Lin- guistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a text analysis program that counts emotion words (Pennebaker et al.,  2007 ), with the performance of human judges in terms of predicting the self-reported felt emo- tions of the sharers. They found that, unlike LIWC, the human judges’ ratings of the emotionality of posts consistently predicted how people felt. This finding supports the notion that human categorization of emo- tions reflected in social media text can be used as a ground truth to validate algorithmic classification of emotions. To test this in our own data, we also used LIWC to measure anger, anxiety, and sadness in the reactions and com- pared the performance of this method with our Word Embedding approach, using the ground truth sample. Table  5 shows that Word Embedding consistently outperformed LIWC in categorizing emotions similarly to human judges. Therefore, we believe the use of Word Embedding, and more specifically, the Word2Vec method is an appropriate way to label reflected emotions in the reaction posts. It should be noted, however, that these are still proxies for felt emotion and may be conservatively interpreted as communicated emotion. Figure  3  shows the final conceptual model, which includes the specific types of stressors, social coping behaviors, occupational contexts, and listener responses that emerged from the data as well as the sharer reactions we labeled. The arrows in the model represent the relationships between components that we will explore in the results section."
3 RESULTS,"3 RESULTS Descriptive statistics of all the variables we extracted from the textual data are presented in Table  6  and correlation tables for these variables are available in  Tables S2  and  S3  in the online supplementary document. First, we noted some interesting relationships between different listener responses. For example, the data show that informational support, reciprocal sharing, and reframing are all moderately to highly correlated with each other, with correlations of .29 (informational support and reciprocal sharing), .46 (informational support and reframing), and .50 (reciprocal sharing and reframing). What seems to be common among these is that they represent “cooler,” more cogni- tive approaches to responding. Informational support often included advice about what to do, reciprocal sharing 26 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .

SAJJADIANI  ET AL    . 27    FIGURE 3 Theoretical model based on findings appeared to be used often as a way to demonstrate how to address a problem through the lens of the lis- tener’s own personal experience, and reframing involved appeals to appraise the situation differently. The other pattern we identified is that informational support was negatively related to positive socioemotional support ( r  =  –.16) and negative socioemotional support ( r  =  –.14). One interpretation of this pattern is that socioemo- tional support is used as a response when listeners do not have useful information or advice to offer. Finally, we note that negative socioemotional support and opposition are positively related ( r  =  .11), perhaps suggest- ing a general negative emotional tone in the conversation and/or the discussion of controversial or polarizing issues. Next, we addressed our research questions, which were motivated by a desire to better understand the dynamic process of online social coping. To do so, we examined the cues that listeners use to respond to online social coping attempts and the impact of both those cues and listeners’ responses on the affective reactions of the sharer. Given that our quantitative models comprise many variables, we only report significant findings that indi- cate a theoretically-meaningful pattern in the text, and direct the reader to Tables  7–8  for the details of these results."
3.1 Research Question 1 and 2,"3.1 Research Question 1 and 2 Our first two research questions refer to the cues (work-related stressors and social coping behaviors) that influ- ence the listener’s response and the moderating role of the occupational context match. As presented in Table  7 , considering that posts are nested within conversations, we examined these relationships using multi-level regression models of each of the responses (informational support, positive socioemotional support, negative socioemotional support, opposition, reciprocal sharing, and reframing) on coping behaviors (seeking informational support, shar- ing anger, sharing fear, and sharing sadness), the 18 work-related stressors, occupational context match, and the interactions between these two sets of cues and occupational context match. There are several significant rela- tionships for both stressors and coping behaviors, indicating that, overall, listeners respond to these two cues independently. 28 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .

3.2 Relationship between work-related stressors and listener responses,"3.2 Relationship between work-related stressors and listener responses A key dimension by which the stressors seem to vary is how occupation-specific or universal they are. For example, we found several stressors that are explicitly field-specific (e.g., nursing, postal work, retail), but also many that repre- sent concerns that employees may face in any occupation (e.g., HR/Management-related issues, work-family conflict). A salient pattern of relationships between work-related stressors and listener responses is that the more universal stressors are more likely to invite informational support. For example, Table  7  shows that the probability of provid- ing informational support was positively related to career path ambiguity ( b  =  .14,  p  <  .001), HR/management-related issues ( b  =  .16,  p  <  .001), mismanagement of EDI issues ( b  =  .10,  p  <  .001), work-family conflict ( b  =  .06,  p  <  .001), con- cerns about viability of quitting ( b  =  .08,  p  <  .001), and job search/application ambiguity ( b  =  .08,  p  <  .001). This could be because these are all issues that many employees face and listeners are less likely to need specific occupational knowledge to respond. Conversely, we found that stressors that are tied to specific occupations were met with less informational sup- port. This included essential work concerns ( b  =  –.08,  p  <  .001), field-specific nursing concerns ( b  =  –.19,  p  <  .001), field-specific postal work concerns ( b  =  –.07,  p  <  .001), and retail worker concerns ( b  =  –.14,  p  <  .001). However, the occupational context match mitigated these negative relationships, such that listeners with similar occupational contexts as the sharers were more likely to provide informational support for occupation-specific stressors. This inter- actionwasobservedforessentialworkconcerns( b = .03, p < .05),nursingconcerns( b = .20, p < .001),andretailworker concerns ( b  =  .05,  p  <  .001). Figure  B1  in Appendix  B  shows the plot of these interactions. Together, this pattern of findings suggests: P1. Listeners  are  less (vs. more) likely to respond to types of stressors that are (are not) occupationally specific with informational support . P2. The negative relationship  between  occupational specificity of the shared stressor and informational support is mitigated by occupational context match . Similarly, Table  7  shows that listeners are more likely to respond with reciprocal sharing when the stressor is more common, and thus more frequently experienced by others regardless of their occupational contexts. For example, the probability of reciprocal sharing was positively related to concerns about viability of quitting ( b  =  .17,  p  <  . 001), HR/management-related issues ( b  =  .08,  p  <  .05), scheduling mismanagement ( b  =  .11,  p  <  .01), work-family conflict ( b  =  .63,  p  <  .001), and disrespectful workplace environment ( b  =  .13,  p  <  .01). Conversely, we found that stressors that manifest uniquely in specific occupational settings were met with less reciprocal sharing, such as essential work concerns ( b  =  –.13,  p  <  .001), field-specific nursing concerns ( b  =  –.42,  p  <  .001), inadequacy of compensation and benefits ( b  =  –.21,  p  <  .001), and unemployment assis- tance issues ( b  =  –.12,  p  <  .001). Occupational context match also seemed to play a significant role in how listeners responded to occupationally-specific stressors with reciprocal sharing. There were significant interac- tions between the occupational match variable and essential worker concerns ( b  =  .11,  p  <  .01), field-specific nursing concerns ( b  =  .73,  p  <  .001), field-specific postal work concerns ( b  =  .09,  p  <  .05), and field-specific teaching concerns ( b  =  .12,  p  <  .05), as well as inadequacy of compensation and benefits ( b  =  .14,  p  <  .001). Figure  B2  includes two exemplar plots. This pattern of findings generally mirrors the interactions we observed for informational support and the theoretical rationale may be the same. That is, when listeners lack the occupation-specific knowledge and experience that is relevant to these kinds of stressors, they are less likely to try to provide guidance through the lens of their own experiences. Putting these findings together, we propose: 38 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .    P3 . Listeners  are less (vs. more) likely to respond to types of stressors that are (are not) occupationally specific with reciprocal sharing . P4. The relationship between occupationally-specific stressors and reciprocal sharing varies depending on the occupational context match of the listener, such that a match mitigates the negative relationship between these stressors and reciprocal sharing."
3.3 Relationship between social coping behaviors and listener responses,"3.3 Relationship between social coping behaviors and listener responses Next, we examine the relationship between the sharer’s social coping behavior (i.e., informational support seeking and/or emotional social sharing) and the listener’s response. Informational support seeking was positively related to received informational support ( b  =  .18,  p  <  .001) and reciprocal sharing ( b  =  .26,  p  <  .001), but was negatively related to positive socioemotional support ( b  =  –.08,  p  <  .001). Taken together, this suggests that explicitly seeking information signals to listeners that the sharer has a deficit of information and does not need to be comforted. As such, we propose: P5. Listeners are more likely to respond to informational support seeking with (a) information and (b) reciprocal sharing, and (c) they are less likely to respond with positive socioemotional support. The effects of emotional social sharing are a bit more complex and depend on the discrete emotion (i.e., anger, sad- ness, and fear) that is being expressed. One pattern that emerged is related to the grouping of more cognitive-oriented responses noted above (i.e., informational support, reciprocal sharing, and reframing). The results suggest that sharing of anger is less likely to elicit these more cognitive-oriented responses ( b information     =  –.18,  p  <  .001;  b r eciprocal     =  –.17, p  <  .001;  b reframing     =  –.09,  p  <  .001), but that sharing of fear is more likely to elicit them ( b information     =  .04,  p  <  .001; b reciprocal     =  .08,  p  <  .05;  b reframing     =  .10,  p  <  .001). One explanation for this may be that anger is associated with appraisals of high certainty, whereas fear is associated with appraisals of low certainty (Smith & Ellsworth,  1985 ). According to social functional accounts of emotion (Frijda,  1986 ; van Kleef,  2009 ), emotional expressions may provide cues regard- ingtheexpresser’sunderlyingmotivationalstate.Thus,listenersmayinferfromtheexpressionofangerthatthesharer is more certain about the issue they are facing and may be less likely to change their mind, which explains a reduction in the use of these more cognitive responses that may change the way the person thinks or behaves. Conversely, fear signals that the person is quite uncertain and thus may be more accepting of information, advice in the form of per- sonal stories, and attempts to reframe one’s appraisals. Sadness is more moderate in terms of the certainty appraisals it conveys, which would explain why the effects for that expressed emotion are generally weaker. We propose the following: P6. Listeners are (a) less likely to respond to emotions characterized by high certainty appraisals (e.g., anger) and (b) more likely to respond to emotions characterized by low certainty appraisals (e.g., fear) with cognitive oriented responses (e.g., informational support, reciprocal sharing, and reframing). Expressed anger was also negatively associated with positive socioemotional support ( b  =  –.03,  p  <  .01), whereas both sadness ( b  =  .02,  p  <  .05) and fear ( b  =  .03,  p  <  .05) were positively related to it. Sadness and fear are both withdrawal-oriented emotions and signal a desire for warmth and positive emotional support from others, whereas anger is more approach-oriented and does not signal a desire for emotional connection (Scherer,  1997 ). Again, draw- ing from social functional accounts of emotional expression (e.g., Frijda,  1986 ; van Kleef,  2009 ), this pattern of results could be because the listener is inferring these desires and responding in kind. As such: SAJJADIANI  ET AL    . 39    P7. Listeners are more likely to respond to withdrawal-oriented emotions (e.g., sadness and fear), but less likely to respond to approach-oriented emotions (e.g., anger) with forms of positive socioemotional support. Another interesting pattern that we identified for anger is that it is positively related to both negative socioemo- tional support ( b  =  .13,  p  <  .001) and opposition ( b  =  .04,  p  <  .001). This might be due to the highly contagious nature of expressed anger (Barsade et al.,  2018 ), which may cause the listeners to also experience more anger and provide these two more negatively-valenced responses. Given that anger is an other-focused and confrontational emotion, it may also lead the listener to “take a side,” either in support of the sharer (in the case of negative socioemotional support) or in support of the target of the sharer’s anger (in the case of opposition), depending on how the listener appraises the anger-inducing situation (Mitchell et al.,  2015 ). The positive effect on opposition was further strengthened when there was an occupational-context match ( b  =  .02,  p  <  .001; see Figure  B3  for a plot of this interaction). Extant research sug- gests that emotional contagion occurs more readily between those who share salient characteristics (Gump & Kulik, 1997 ), which might explain this interactive relationship, though occupational context match did not moderate the rela- tionship between anger and negative socioemotional support. We propose the following and also suggest that future research explores the role of occupational similarity in these kinds of contagion effects. P8. Listeners  are  more likely to respond to vented anger with (a) more negative socioemotional support and (b) more opposition . Finally, we observed that occupational context match strongly moderated a number of relationships between expressed fear and responses in a consistent way, whereas the effects were much weaker for expressions of anger and sadness. For example, occupational context match moderated the effects of expressed fear on positive ( b  =  .09, p  <  .001) and negative socioemotional support ( b  =  .10,  p  <  .001), reciprocal sharing ( b  =  .21,  p  <  .001), and refram- ing ( b  =  .08,  p  <  .001). The plots for reciprocal sharing and reframing found in Figure  B4  provide good examples of the nature of these interactions. It seems that the occupational context match plays a greater role in increasing the supportive responses to fear compared to responses to anger or sadness. One explanation for this may be that fear is an emotion that is oriented toward situations (Lerner & Keltner,  2001 ) and these are situations that may be more familiar to those with an occupational context match, triggering a greater sense of empathy and ultimately a stronger supportive response aimed at reducing the fear. P9. Occupational context match increases the likelihood that listeners will respond in ways intended to reduce fear through greater state empathy ."
3.4 Research Question 3,"3.4 Research Question 3 The final research question focused on how sharers reacted to listener responses. To examine these relationships, we ran multi-level regressions of affective reactions reflected in the posts (i.e., satisfaction, anger, sadness, and fear reflected in the sharer’s subsequent posts in the conversation) on (a) the control variables (i.e., all 18 stressors and the response’s score (total upvotes-total downvotes) 3    , (b) listener responses (informational support, positive socioemotional support, negative socioemotional support, opposition, reciprocal sharing, and reframing), (c) the social coping behaviors (i.e., informational support seeking and the shared emotions of anger, sadness, and fear), and (d) the interactions between listener responses and social coping behaviors. We present the full regression results in Table  8 . First, we observed a pattern for informational support seeking such that the positive relationship between infor- mational support seeking and subsequent satisfaction is enhanced when positive socioemotional support is received ( b  =  .65,  p  <  .001) and when reframing is received ( b  =  1.11  p  <  .001; see Figure  B5  for a plot of these results). This may indicate that while the sharers are signaling through their communication that they simply want tangible advice 40 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .    or information (given that the expression of emotions is controlled in the model), they are likely appraising the situa- tions they face as threatening, and so they appreciate expressions of goodwill and empathy as well as attempts to get them to appraise the problem differently. It should also be noted that, although the findings from Research Question 1 showed that informational support seeking did encourage more reframing, it also discouraged positive emotional support. We propose: P10 . Listener  attempts to improve sharer well-being through positive socio-emotional support and reframing are particularly effective in response to solicitations of informational support . Turning to the effects of sharing emotions, we found that the interaction between sharing anger and receiving infor- mational support on the subsequent satisfaction of the sharer was negative ( b  =  –.35,  p  <  .01), though the interaction was not a significant predictor of the sharer’s subsequent anger. The plot of this interaction in Figure  B6  shows that the negative effect of the sharer’s anger expression on satisfaction was exacerbated when they received informational support in response. One explanation for this could be related to the implications of our findings from the first research question, which is that anger is associated with an appraisal of certainty and thus receiving advice is not appreciated. In addition, given that the model also included informational support seeking as a control, information and advice received in response to the expression of anger may be construed as a form of unsolicited advice (see Landis et al., 2022 ), and perhaps even considered condescending. Extant research also suggests that anger reduces the likelihood that people will accept and act on the advice they receive (de Hooge et al.,  2014 ). We propose: P11. The  negative  relationship between sharing anger and reflected satisfaction is stronger when informational support is received . Conversely, the interaction between sharing fear and informational support is significant and positive for the sharer’s satisfaction ( b  =  .26,  p  <  .05). As displayed in Figure  B7a , the positive effect of sharing fear on satisfaction is stronger when listeners provide more informational support, perhaps suggesting that the sharer may not view this unsolicited advice as unhelpful or condescending given that fear may communicate a sense of uncertainty (Smith & Ellsworth, 1985). Interestingly, though, the interaction was also significant and positive for the subsequent expres- sion of fear in the sharer’s posts ( b  =  .81,  p  <  .001). Figure  B7b  shows that the positive relationship between the fear shared in the original post and the fear expressed in subsequent reactions is stronger when receiving informational support. One explanation for this is that, although informational support may be appreciated as a prosocial attempt to help the sharer, it might increase fear because it validates that there is a real reason to be afraid. Research sug- gests that fear is related to rumination and increased focus on danger (Roseman et al.,  1994 ) and it is possible that unsolicited advice enhances the concern that something may go wrong for the sharer. This is further supported by the pattern of effects we observed for the interaction between shared fear and reciprocal sharing ( b satisfaction     =  .23, p  <  .01;  b fea r     =  .19,  p  <  .01), which mirror the effects shown for the interactions with informational support. Thus, we propose: P12. The posit ive effect of sharing fear on (a) satisfaction and (b) subsequent expressions of fear are enhanced when informational support is received. P13. The positive e ffect of sharing fear on (a) satisfaction and (b) subsequent expressions of fear are enhanced when reciprocal sharing is received . The response of reframing also presented an interesting pattern when applied to emotional social sharing. Refram- ing did notmoderate anyofthe effectsofanger butitdid moderate the effectsoffear suchthatitenhanced the positive SAJJADIANI  ET AL    . 41    effect of sharing fear on satisfaction ( b  =  1.41,  p  <  .001) and it weakened the positive effect of sharing fear on subse- quent fear ( b  =  –.47,  p  <  .01). See Figure  B8  for a plot of these interactions. We again draw from the certainty dimension of emotion to explain this effect. It may be that because fear is an aversive emotion related to feelings of uncertainty (Smith & Ellsworth, 1985), it is easier for others to help regulate it by encouraging one to reappraise the situation. However, for relatively more certain emotions like anger and sadness, reframing is not as effective. As such: P14. The (a) positive effect of sharing uncertain emotions like fear on satisfaction is enhanced when reframing is received and the (b) positive effect of sharing uncertain emotions like fear on the subsequent expressions of that emotion is mitigated when reframing is received. Finally, we noted the effects of opposition. In particular, in response to sadness, opposition actually mitigated the positive relationship between shared sadness and subsequent sadness ( b  =  –.42,  p  <  .01) but enhanced the effect on subsequent anger ( b  =  .88,  p  <  .001). See Figure  B9  for plots of these interactions. This may suggest that in the online context, where one has less control over who responds and where there are weaker norms for civility, opposition can shift the emotions expressed by the sharer from sadness to anger. P15. Opposition moderates the relationship between shared sadness and subsequent expressed anger, such that high levels of opposition increase the likelihood that one will express anger ."
4 DISCUSSION,"4 DISCUSSION People rely on others in their social environment to cope with work-related stressors. The literature on work-related stressors and social coping has largely overlooked the dynamic nature of the social coping process and has painted a fragmented picture of this process. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of this process, we integrated existing theories (Bavik et al.,  2020 ; Lazarus & Folkman,  1984 ) to propose a three-phase process model of online social coping (see Figure  1 ), and used conversation-level data from Reddit to develop a theory about this process. We found that workers employ various social coping behaviors (i.e., informational support seeking and/or social sharing of discrete emotions) in this online forum to cope with a range of work-related stressors. The nature of the work- related stressors and the social coping behaviors employed by the sharer are two important sources of information, or cues, inherent in the sharers’ posts that influence the type of listeners’ responses. We also showed that the occu- pational context match can moderate the link between these cues and the listeners’ responses. Finally, we found that the sharer’s cues interact with the listeners’ responses to alter the affective reactions the sharers reflected in their subsequent posts in the conversation."
4.1 Theoretical contributions,"4.1 Theoretical contributions We make a number of theoretical contributions to the social coping literature. First, our findings suggest that listen- ers respond to independent cues related to both the stressors and social coping behaviors embedded in the sharer’s post and that these responses are more nuanced than the simple informational-emotional support dichotomy that is typically employed in this emerging stream of research (e.g., Luo et al.,  2020 ; Wang et al.,  2015 ). This further sup- ports the notion that listener responses are not simply exogenous inputs into the social coping process (Forest et al., 2021 ), but are shaped in theoretically meaningful ways by cues that the sharer conveys in the post. In particular, we show that listeners independently respond to cues related to the stressor and the social coping behavior. For example, based on our findings, we propose that listeners may respond to the occupational specificity of the stressor as well as informational support seeking conveyed by the sharer with informational support and reciprocal sharing. Listeners 42 SAJJADIANI  ET AL    .    also may respond to the certainty appraisal inherent in expressed emotion when deciding whether to provide a more cognitively-oriented response and may respond to the withdrawal-orientation inherent in the expressed emotion when deciding whether to provide positive emotional support. Finally, our findings also suggest that listener responses may be influenced by posts that contain contagious emotions like anger, which relate to the kinds of responses the listener uses. In addition, we develop theory on the effect that listener responses have on the link between sharer social coping behaviors and affective outcomes, dovetailing with emerging research that highlights the importance of the listener’s response (e.g., Baer et al.,  2018 ; Behfar et al.,  2020 ). Taken together with the above findings, our study suggests that social coping behaviors play the dual role of (a) directly relating to affective outcomes and (b) inviting certain listener responses, which then interact with the effect of social coping behaviors. In some cases, these two pathways worked synergistically, but in other cases, the response elicited by the sharer’s cues actually harmed the affective outcome of the sharer. For example, we found that informational support seeking was more likely to encourage informational support and less likely to encourage positive emotional support, but we also found that sharers appreciated receiv- ing positive emotional support when they were seeking information. In another example, we found that shared anger was negatively related to the provision of informational support, which turned out to be a more adaptive listener response. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that sharing fear motivated listeners to provide informational sup- port, reciprocal sharing, and reframing. However, receiving informational support and reciprocal sharing turned out to be more maladaptive responses to that shared fear (in terms of the outcome of subsequently expressed fear), and only reframing appeared to relate to less subsequently-expressed fear. As such, our study contributes to theory on the importance of responses from the social context and how sharers can shape the responses they receive. Finally, this study extends our theoretical understanding of the role of social coping with work-related stressors to the online context. One theoretically important distinction between the in-person and online context is that people are more likely to engage online with those from more diverse occupational backgrounds. In our sample of conversations onReddit, we found meaningful differencesinthe social coping processasa functionofwhether the twopartiesshared the same occupational context or not. Although cross-occupational discussions also occur in face-to-face settings, our findings provide some theoretical clues about how the process of social coping with work-related stressors may play out online, where listeners are likely to come from a variety of occupational backgrounds, and sharers have less ability to direct their coping efforts toward similar others."
4.2 Methodological contributions,"4.2 Methodological contributions We contribute to the emerging field of interpretive data science by enhancing the classical inductive approach through the use of ML techniques. We garnered new theoretical insights by using ML to inductively analyze big textual data collected from Reddit. We specifically used supervised and unsupervised ML, and two neural network word embed- ding models (Word2Vec and BERT) to convert a large unstructured corpus of textual data into meaningful categories and constructs. We evaluated the reliability and validity of these constructs by comparing the performance of these methods with each other and with human-labeled data. We also demonstrated the importance of exercising caution in creating and choosing the ground truth dataset. We did so by comparing the performance of a more powerful ML model (BERT), which was trained on an available Twitter dataset, and a less powerful tool (Word2Vec) that was trained on a training dataset created for this study using Reddit posts. This comparative process proved that the effectiveness of these ML methods can vary depending on the type and content of the data and the relevance of the ground truth dataset. Thus, scholars should use these methods, and especially the pre-trained datasets, with caution. We also provide an example of the value and potential applications of a multi-method ML research design. In the utilization of multiple ML techniques at once, we were able to effectively retrieve and analyze big datasets for a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic, interpersonal interactions involved in the online social coping process.

4.3 Practical contributions,"4.3 Practical contributions This study offers organizations insight into the social coping process and may be used to develop interventions to bet- ter help employees cope with work-related stress. These interventions could be particularly targeted toward aspects of the process that seem to play out in a more maladaptive way online. To illustrate, our results suggest that when employees express their fears online, listeners may try to help the person by providing more information or by sharing their own experiences, but these responses are likely to exacerbate the fear of these employees. As such, organi- zations dealing with fearful employees (e.g., during an organizational change initiative) would do well to implement interventions that encourage reframing at work so that employees do not go home and share their fears online. We also offer insights for employees in terms of how to leverage online resources for dealing with stressors to achieve their desired outcomes. For example, our results suggest that people who seek information without express- ing emotions (e.g., sadness or fear) are only likely to receive informational support in response. So, to the extent that socioemotional support may be needed, one should express emotion. In addition, these insights may help employees to better respond to their coworkers’ social coping attempts, which may improve workplace interpersonal relationships and employee well-being."
4.4 Limitations and future directions,"4.4 Limitations and future directions Our study has several limitations. First, our research setting is limited to online conversations on Reddit. As such, our results might not be generalizable to in-person coping. Research suggests that online interactions can be more adver- sarial and emotional (Crockett,  2017 ), though little is known about whether and how this dynamic process plays out differently with in-person interactions (McFarland & Ployhart,  2015 ). For instance, why do some employees choose to cope with work stressors using social media  after work  instead of sharing their problems with coworkers and super- visors  at work ? What are the organizational factors (e.g., psychological safety, organizational culture) that affect this dynamic process? Therefore, a promising avenue for future research is to develop an understanding of how online social coping is used in relation to in-person social coping and whether social coping on social media has any effects on workers’ in-person social coping (e.g., Cole et al.,  2017 ; Trepte et al.,  2015 ). A second potential limitation is that we were only able to model sharer outcomes as short-term affective reactions. Although we believe that these affective reactions are important, they do not directly speak to how this coping process may affect more chronic stress patterns and work outcomes. We suggest that a fruitful area for future research would be to adopt a temporal lens, which may offer insight into how the process that plays out in a single conversation affects subsequent conversations, and how these conversations over time contribute to longer-lasting effects for the person engaging in social coping.

ENDNOTES,"ENDNOTES 1    Similar to Min et al. ( 2021 ), we found a very high correlation between anger and disgust ( r  =  .93). The correlation between disgust and anger was relatively high ( r  =  .46) when using the Word2Vec model as well. Additionally, we repeated all the analysesreportedintheresultssectionusingangeranddisgustasseparatevariables.Thedirectionandsignificanceofeffects were consistently similar for these two variables. Therefore, we combined the two variables in our analyses. 2    Using  t -tests, we compared cases when the sharer came back compared to when the sharer did not come back to the con- versation and found no large or statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of the content of the original posts (stressors and social coping behaviors) or the nature of the listener responses (see the results in Table  S4  in the online supplementary document). 3    This represents the average score (based on upvotes and downvotes) of all the responses in the conversation. We included this as a control to account for the fact that sharer reactions may also be influenced by how others reacted to a particular response in addition to the content of the response."
