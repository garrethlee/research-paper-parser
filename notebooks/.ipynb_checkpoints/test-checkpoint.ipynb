       "[Research on social networks has demonstrated time and time again that the size, breadth, and reach of people ’ s social networks are positively correlated with several bene ﬁ cial outcomes, including access to valuable opportunities, resources, and information (e.g., Burt 1992, Wasserman and Faust  1994 ). Con- sequently, an important ongoing research agenda for social, organizational, and network science in- volves identifying differences in the kinds of social networks people have and the origins of these dif- ferences (e.g., Hall and Wellman  1985 , Campbell et al. 1986 , McPherson et al.  2001 ). Among the many  ﬁ nd- ings from this research, one of the most common, and most robust, is that across a range of scales and contexts, high-status people tend to have larger, more expansive social networks than low-status people (e.g., Wasserman and Faust,  1994 , Brashears  2011 , Smith et al.  2012 ).,\n",
       "   The motivating question for the present paper is, in a word, why? Existing research offers two potential answers. One potential answer is  experience-centric  and proposes that high-status people, relative to low-status people, are more likely to be part of multiple social circles, in part as a function of higher educational attainment and greater professional mobility (e.g., Hill and Dunbar 2003 ); as a result, they accumulate more social con- nections over time. A second answer, which invokes a more  alter-centric  perspective, builds on the premise that people are generally status seeking in their social af ﬁ liations (e.g., Bothner et al.  2010 , Yu and Xie  2017 ). As a result, high-status people bene ﬁ t from their in- creased likelihood of being sought out by others, which can increase the size and reach of their social networks. Bycomparison,thispaper builds upon therecent swell of research examining the psychological underpinnings of social network phenomena (e.g. Kilduff and Krackhardt 1994 , Smith et al.  2012 , Brashears  2013 , Casciaro et al. 2014 , Kuwabara et al.  2018 , Mehra et al.  2001 , Menon and Smith  2014 , Shea et al.  2015 ) and proposes an  ego- centric  behavioral mechanism to further explain the relationship between social status and social network structure. Speci ﬁ cally, the ego-centric perspective that we advance here proposes that one ’ s status po- sition in ﬂ uences individual psychology and behav- iors, which subsequently changes social network structure. The ego-centric perspective provides a sig- ni ﬁ cant extension for the current social networks and status literature, which often emphasizes the role of structural availability in shaping individual social networks (Ibarra  1992 , Reagans  2005 , Kleinbaum et al. 2013 ) and studies the status dynamic largely from the perspective of the status-observers (Merton 1968 , Berger et al.  1972 , Webster and Entwisle  1976 , Rosenthal and Jacobson  1992 , Hardy and Van Vugt 2006 , Van Der et al.  2006 , Larivi`ere and Gingras  2009 ). By comparison, we pay attention to the agentic role that individuals play in creating their social networks and study the status dynamic from the perspective of the status-holders. Our core argument consists of two main parts. First, we propose that high-status people are more likely than low-status peopletoengage innetwork-broadening behaviors — that is, to reach out to friends of friends or others with whom they are not well acquainted. Importantly, we anticipate this tendency to hold, inde- pendent of whether high-status people have more ties in their  “ potential networks ”  to begin with, as we sus- pect they do (Smith et al.  2012 ).,\n",
       "   As compared with the initial two mechanisms that we highlight, we will investigate how status affects people ’ s psychology and in ﬂ uences their likelihood of engaging in network- broadening behaviors. Second, we hypothesize that a primary enabler of network-broadening behaviors among high-status people, and simultaneously a pri- mary deterrent of such behavior among low-status people, relates to people ’ s belief in the extent to which social status is legitimate (Tyler  2006 ); in other words, social status and quality are tightly coupled. In short, we argue that the frequently observed positive relationship between social status and network size may be driven by people ’ s belief that status is a reliable indicator of quality. This belief, combined with social status, produces a joint effect on people ’ s network- broadening behaviors. When the belief is high, high- status people are likely to view themselves as valuable to others. Given that networking is about resource and value exchange (Lin  1999 ,  2001 ; Burt  2000 ), the heightened perceived self-value leads high-status peo- ple to expect that others will be receptive to their at- tempts at networking, which subsequently increases high-status people ’ s willingness to network broadly. By comparison, we theorize that low-status people who believe status and quality to be tightly coupled will be less likely to think of themselves as valuable to others and subsequently lower their expected re- ceptivity from the targets of their networking, thereby rendering them more reluctant to engage in network- broadening. When people do not believe status and quality to be tightly coupled, by contrast, the positive relationship between status and network-broadening will diminish, because status is no longer associated with the level of value that one perceives herself has. Results of seven separate studies, including one pilot study, support our predictions. High- and low- status people who believe that status and quality are tightly coupled differ — in the expected directions — in their network-broadening behaviors, as well as in the size of their reported social networks, or  “ ego-networks. ” These same differences are signi ﬁ cantly weaker or nonexistent among high- and low-status people who view social status and quality as less tightly coupled. Importantly, our data also indicate that both high- and low-status people tend to believe that social status is in fact a reliable indicator of quality, both in their work- places and in general. This observation presents im- portant implications for research on the psychology of status, the dynamics of social networking, and the maintenance of social hierarchy. Whereas a belief in status-quality coupling is likely to bene ﬁ t high-status people, it may simultaneously undermine low-status people ’ s willingness and ability to both build and bene ﬁ t from larger social networks. We review two important streams of status re- search that adopt two different conceptualizations of status: the admiration and respect conceptualization (Ridgeway and Walker  1995 , Magee and Galinsky 2008 ) and the unobserved-quality conceptualization (Podolny  1993 , Benjamin and Podolny  1999 , Lynn et al.  2009 ). Next, we synthesize the two conceptu- alizations and formally introduce the concept of belief in status-quality coupling. Lastly, we explain the speci ﬁ c mechanisms by which people ’ s beliefs (or disbeliefs) in coupling affect how they network.]"
